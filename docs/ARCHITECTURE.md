# How the updater works

This is the map of the program: what the exe is, what happens between "Update roster" and the
new save, where each decision lives in the code, and where new features plug in. The save
format itself is in [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md); how to build, test and change things is in
[DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md); data refreshes and releases are in [MAINTAINING.md](MAINTAINING.md).

## In one paragraph

The user's RPCS3 holds roster saves of NHL Legacy Edition. The program reads one of them,
fetches today's NHL rosters from NHL.com, takes everything else (current ratings, national teams,
European club rosters) from a bundled "data pack", rewrites the roster database in memory,
checks the result against every rule the game is known to enforce, and writes it as a **new**
save folder next to the old ones. It changes an existing save only when the player chooses "Update this roster" (a backup copy first,
`savedata.update_in_place`), and never deletes one by itself (the player's own **Delete** button in the window moves one to the
Recycle Bin, `savedata.trash_save`), never adds a
team and never moves a team to another league (hard limits of the game).

## The two programs

| File | Built from | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `NHLLegacyRosterUpdater.exe` | `packaging/launcher.py` | The window (about 26 MB). No pictures inside since 0.32.0: it downloads the picture packs (see "Photos and logos"). `legacy_roster.__main__.main()` opens the window when started without arguments and runs the command line when given some (but as a windowed program it has no console to print to). Since 0.6.0 the only window program (owner, 2026-10-04): 0.4–0.5 also had a plain one without the pictures. |
| `NHLLegacyRosterUpdater-cli.exe` | `packaging/launcher_cli.py` | The command line (`list`, `update`, `export`, `photos`), with a console. Built without Tk. |

Both are PyInstaller **one-file** builds (`packaging/build.ps1`). On every start the exe unpacks
Python, the `legacy_roster` package and `legacy_roster/data/` into a temporary `_MEI…` folder, so
the window takes about 3 seconds to appear. Code finds its files through `__file__`
(`theme.DATA`, `datasource.BUNDLED_PACK`), which works the same from source and from the exe.
The exe is not signed, so Windows SmartScreen warns on first start.

Dependencies: the engine and the command line use only the Python standard library, except
"Photos and logos", which draws pictures with Pillow (`art/images.py`, imported only when the
switch is on; both exes carry it). The window adds [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com)
(Edge WebView2 through pythonnet on Windows, WebKit on Mac / Linux) and, for the classic window kept as a fallback in
0.10.x, [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). PyInstaller is used only to build.

## Without RPCS3

`savedata.SaveFolder` stands in for an RPCS3 when the player picks a folder with roster saves (or
one roster save) instead: the command line's `--savedata`, or a remembered path that is no RPCS3
(`App.set_rpcs3` falls back to `savedata.open_saves`). It has the save folder and the versions
found there, but no game folder and no game disc, so the photos switch is off, "The game's own
roster" is not listed and there is no "Start RPCS3". The new roster goes next to the others
(`savedata.install`). For a tester running the Windows exe in CrossOver with the Mac RPCS3 (0.8.0).

**Export only SYS-DATA roster** (0.9.0, a Linux user's request, owner 2026-10-07): the checkbox in Setup's "Where is RPCS3?" (classic window: under step 1; `App.export_mode`,
`toggle_export`, `_refresh_export`) needs no RPCS3 and no save folder. "Which roster do you work on?" asks for the community roster's SYS-DATA file
(`pick_export_file`: `layout.check_base`, the game's own roster is refused), "Make new roster" runs `pipeline.export_sysdata`
(the normal gather and build, checks and report, no photos/logos/jerseys) and writes `NHL Legacy roster <date time>/SYS-DATA` next
to the exe (`pipeline.export_root`: the program's folder, else Documents). A new folder every time, nothing is overwritten;
`cli export-roster`. `tools/window_shot.py export|export-ready`; `tests/test_export.py`.

## What happens when the user presses "Update roster"

1. **Window** (the Update tab's "Update roster": `UpdateController.start`, `app/update.py`): marks the controller
   busy and runs the work through `jobs.run` in a worker thread. Every message the engine reports goes to the details
   log and the status line and becomes a percentage with `progress.fraction()` (section "The window"). The classic
   window does the same with `gui.App.start`, `App.work` and `App.poll` (every 100 ms on the Tk thread).
2. **`pipeline.update(savedata, source_folder, steps, name, progress)`**:
   1. `savedata.find_savedata()` and `list_rosters()` → the source roster (`savedata.Slot`), or
      `disc=` a `savedata.DiscSlot`: the game's own roster (section "The game's own roster").
   2. Reads its `SYS-DATA` (`savedata.read_roster`; for a DiscSlot `stock.from_disc`).
   3. `datasource.load_pack()` → the newest data pack: a downloaded one (`PACK_URL`, on the
      file server), the cached download, or the copy bundled in the exe. "Newest" = highest `generated`.
   4. `layout.check_base()` → the layout: `COMMUNITY` or `STOCK` (the game's own); refuses any
      other team layout with a message the player can act on. Community rosters whose custom
      copies of NHL teams are out of step (the community's 2026-27 roster) pass: a copy is
      recognised by its name (`MIRROR_NAMES`) or by sharing most players with its team.
   5. `datasource.gather()` → a `builder.Data`: NHL.com rosters (32 requests, cached 20 minutes),
      players those rosters leave out (injured, reassigned: player search + landing page,
      cached 6 hours), and the parts of the pack the chosen steps need.
   6. `pipeline.build()` → runs the steps (next section) and `verify()`.
   7. Any problem from `verify()` → writes `reports\failed_<time>.csv` and returns; **nothing is
      saved**.
   8. `savedata.install()` → the next free folder `<TITLEID>02NN`, once per version of the game
      in `targets` (EU `BLES02153`, NA `BLUS31540`; default: the source's version). `ICON0.PNG`
      and `PARAM.SFO` are copied from the source save with a new `SAVEDATA_DIRECTORY` and
      `SUB_TITLE` (the roster name); for the other version they come from that version's newest
      roster save, else from the source with that version's `TITLE` (`savedata._model_for`).
      Starting from the game's own roster with no save of that version at all: `PARAM.SFO` is
      made from scratch (`savedata.roster_sfo`, byte-identical to the game's own) and the icon
      is the disc's `PS3_GAME/ICON0.PNG` (`stock.disc_icon`).
      Then `SYS-DATA` is written and read back. The folder is assembled next to `savedata` and
      renamed in, so the game never sees half a save.
   9. Writes the list of changes (`write_report`): `reports\<folder>_<time>.html`, a page grouped
      by part and team with full team names and a search box (`report.py`), which "List of
      changes" opens, and the same rows as `.csv` next to it.
   10. With "Photos and logos" on: installs the pictures (section "Photos and logos").
3. **Result**: the Update tab shows the green result (`UpdateController._done`; classic window `App.report`): one
   line per part of the update (`BuildResult.lines()`), the photos line, how to load it in the game, and the buttons.
   A failure shows the red one (`_failed`, `App.failed`).

The command line runs the same `pipeline.update()`; `--dry-run` stops before step 8.

## The engine: `pipeline.build()`

Steps run in this fixed order, whatever order they are given in:

| # | Step key | Code | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | – | `Roster(src)`, `check_base`, `stock.prepare` (game's own roster only), `draft.apply`, `Builder(R, data, layout=)`, `reserve_listed` | Parse, check the layout, write everyone's real draft (0.8.0, `draft.py`), index entries, links and ratings, detect maintain mode, prepare donors. The club leagues are worked out here (`usable_clubs`, `with_own_teams`: a player's own custom team named after a left-out club joins its league), and the players they and the IIHF squads list are reserved (`b.listed_rows`: never reused, never retired). Every change-log row is tagged with its part (`builder.ChangeLog`, `log.section`) |
| 1 | `nhl` | `Builder.nhl_rosters()` | (Game's own roster, first update: its 2014 national teams are emptied, `clear_national`.) Free agents who `would_retire` retire first (`settle_free_agents`, 0.8.0). Players on no official NHL roster leave their NHL entry (free agent unless still on another pro team; one who `would_retire` retires: `Builder.retires`). Every listed player goes onto his team: his entry there, his entry moved from another NHL team, an AHL/pool/junior entry promoted (`source_rank`), a new entry, or a new player record (`create_player`). A matched skater gets NHL.com's position (`nhl_position`, 0.6.0), and one matched without his birthdate gets NHL.com's (`nhl_birthdate`); every NHL player gets NHL.com's height, weight, hand and birthplace (`nhl_bio`, 0.8.0). Then last season's NHL players who are unsigned now become free agents, created if the save lacks them (`add_unsigned`, data pack `nhl_last`). Jersey numbers from NHL.com; a clash goes to the official number, then to whoever already wears it, then to the better player, and the loser keeps his old number so a re-run changes nothing |
| 2 | `ratings` | `Builder.apply_list_ratings()` | The ratings list's attributes written exactly: stored = rating − 36, field per attribute in `schema.LIST_SKATER` / `LIST_GOALIE`. Players with only an overall are shifted until their level matches it. Fields the list does not publish (potential, growth, traits) are left alone. Rated players go into `b.list_rated`. Then `donors.refresh()` chooses the spare records again with the new ratings (a retired player the list still rates can drop below the legend line; a second run must find the same spares) |
| 3 | `nhl` | `nhl_lines()`, `sync_mirrors()` | Departed players' line slots and letters go to newcomers, then lines are re-dealt by rating within each team's own structure (a team without one gets `lines_from_scratch`). A slot set's class comes from its even-strength slots (`lines.slot_role`), and a wing's set goes to a winger of its side first (`lines.wing_side`, unless the other side's winger is `lines.SIDE_MARGIN` better). Custom teams 222–233 are made identical copies of their NHL team (`Builder.mirrors`: none on the game's own roster); a player who was only on the copy becomes a free agent |
| 4 | `national` | `fill_empty_national()` | Fills every national team the source leaves empty (the base's 8, and squads a community roster emptied): the IIHF roster, NHL players by nationality, then the country's players elsewhere in the save where positions are short; at most 26. A country that cannot dress 2 G + 18 skaters stays empty (summary line). Runs before the club leagues because its new players need records, and the junior leagues, last in line, are the ones that run short |
| 5 | league keys | `stock.retire_leftovers()` (every roster since 0.8.0), `clubs.core_needs()`, then `leagues/clubs.update_league()` per league in `pipeline.LEAGUE_ORDER` | Club names on the slots (not on a player's own team, `own`); players matched (`match_club`) or created; old players the league no longer lists retire before any of this (`retire_leftovers`); former occupants become free agents; displaced prospect pools move to spare slots (`pools.relocate`); short clubs topped up to a dressable 20 (`_fill_lineup`); numbers, lines (`lines.build_lines`), letters. Records for later leagues' line-ups are held back from depth players (`b.core_reserve`) |
| 6 | (any league) | `leagues/pools.settle()` | Pool slots trimmed to 40, best prospects kept, overflow moved to pools with room or made free agents; lines for changed pools |
| 7 | `national` | `national_teams()`, `national_lines()` | Keeps national squads current: a member no longer active in the NHL makes room for the best eligible NHL player of his position (eligible = the save's nationality and NHL.com's birth country agree). Places of members who retired in this run are filled the same way (`national_gaps`). On a first build, up to 4 rising stars (24 or younger) per team replace the weakest member who would not retire; not in maintain mode and not for squads filled in step 4. Removed players with no club become free agents. A squad with players but no line slots (Czech Republic and Denmark in the 2026-27 community roster) gets lines dealt from scratch |
| 7b | always | `goalie_gear()` | A goalie whose club changed (or a new one) gets the coloured parts of his pads, blocker and glove (`lVMf`) in the club's colours; white, grey and black stay (0.8.0) |
| 8 | always | `contracts()` | Contract team (`cPbu.team` = team + 1) must be a team the player is on; free agents have no contract fields (their NHL rights in `proteam` stay). New and moved players get a default deal on the roster's money scale (`contracts.default_terms`) |
| 8a | `nhl` + pack `contracts` | `real_contracts()` | The real 2026-27 deal (cap hit, seasons, two-way, extension) for every player the pack has on an NHL deal who is on an NHL or AHL team here. Money scale (`contracts.py`): real dollars on a game-patch roster, x 71.4 / 104.0 otherwise; `pipeline.build` rescales a roster that changes scale once, before step 1 |
| 8b | always | `draft.apply()` again | The real draft for players made or renamed in this run |
| 9 | always | `finish()` | Drops deleted entries, renumbers `key = team × 40 + slot` without gaps, rewrites the free-agent list, and drops the player links (`caBZ`) of removed entries that nothing (entries, free agents, draft picks) uses any more. New links take the lowest free id below 16,000 (`LINK_LIMIT`). Without this every update used more of the 9,955 links |
| 10 | always | `RosterFile.build()` (`tdb.py`) | Packs the tables, recomputes the checksum chain, compresses, writes the wrapper CRCs |
| 11 | always | `verify()` | See "Safety net" |

### A club league in detail (`leagues/clubs.py`)

1. `listed()`: the league's players once each (a feed may list a player twice). `match_club()`
   finds their records. The DEL gives ages only (`birth_approx`): those players match by full name and a birth year
   that fits, and a match brings the save's exact birthdate.
2. `creation_order()`: matched players first, then each club's **core** (what it lacks for 2 G,
   6 D, 12 F, best estimated first), then **depth**. Depth players are created only while records
   remain beyond `b.core_reserve` (what later leagues need for their cores).
3. Per player:
   - **Skipped:**
     - on an NHL roster (NHL.com wins);
     - already placed by an earlier league in this run (`b.placed`: the first league keeps him).
   - **Matched:** his entry is moved or created on the club, and other club, pool and junior entries go.
     - The league's position is applied to club-only players (`_feed_position`; national-team members
       keep theirs).
     - A stale record from the game's own years gets its birth year fixed and is re-estimated, unless the ratings list rates him.
     - AHL players coming down from the NHL get the list's rating if it lists them.
   - **New:**
     - a record from `take_record()` (none left: skipped and logged);
     - The list's rating if it has one (`b.list_rating_for`), else an estimate.
   - **Contract:** contract team is the club. In the AHL, players the feed marks `nhl_contract` get
     the parent club's rights (`affiliates()`) and a two-way deal (`_nhl_contract`).
4. **Former occupants of the slots:**
   - club players become free agents (`b.release`), except players under 20 (`STAY_AGE`), who stay
     with their club when the league's list leaves them out (0.8.0: the WHL's 2026-27 list has no
     Landon DuPont; as a free agent the draft would not see him);
   - pool players go to `pools.relocate`.

   Before that, `_place_prospects()` brings in the undrafted prospects of this league's country
   (`HOME_LEAGUE`; the CHL takes everyone else) who are in a prospect pool, on the free-agent list or
   on no team: they join the club with the most room (fewer than `PROSPECT_ROOM`) as if they had been
   there, so the next run, which finds them as former players who stay, takes exactly the same path.
   Prospects a league lists are left to it (`b.league_rows`). The game's own roster keeps its draft classes
   on junior and European clubs; the community's pools end up on custom teams, which the draft does
   not see (owner, 0.8.0).
   Then `_fill_lineup()` keeps former players of a missing position. Then it signs from the
   prospect pools or free agents (junior-age only for the CHL). A second run therefore keeps the same
   fillers.
5. **Per slot:**
   - over 40: the weakest leave;
   - numbers;
   - lines, but only if the club can dress 20 (otherwise its lines are cleared and it leaves `rebuilt`,
     so `verify` does not hold it to a full line-up);
   - letters.

### Shared state in `Builder` (`builder.py`)

- `log`: rows `[team, change, player, detail, number]`. The report CSV and both summaries
  (`BuildResult.headline()` for the banner, `summary()` for the details) are made from it.
- `deleted`: roster entry indexes removed at `finish()`. Entries are never deleted mid-run, so
  indexes stay valid.
- `arrivals` and `departures`: which team gained or lost whom, so the line slots of departed
  players can be handed to newcomers.
- `fa_links`: the free-agent list, kept consistent with the roster entries. `release(e, live)`
  takes an entry off its team. A player left on no club team goes onto this list, unless he is a
  second record of someone (`records_of`). **Nobody is dropped without a team:** a record that
  became teamless and is not a free agent would be reused on the next run, and that run would no
  longer be byte-identical.
- **Retiring** (0.8.0). `would_retire(pid)`: `retire_age` or older (30 on the game's own roster, 35
  otherwise, `FA_RETIRE_AGE`), not in the NHL last season (`last_season`, from `nhl_last`), not on an
  NHL.com roster, not listed by a league or an IIHF squad (`listed_rows`). `retires()` then clears his
  contract and rights, frees his places on national teams (`national_gaps`) and NHL copies, and makes
  the record spare. **Every retirement happens before any player is created:** free agents
  (`settle_free_agents`), NHL leavers (step 1), club leftovers (`retire_leftovers`, before the leagues).
  A record freed later could only be used by the next update, which would then differ. For the same
  reason a national team is never filled with, and a rising-star swap never drops, a player who would
  retire.
- `donors` (`donors.py`): where a new player's record comes from. The player table cannot
  grow, so a new player takes over:
  1. a blanked "ZZ" record;
  2. else a teamless record of a former player, oldest first (`real_birth_year`: records from the game's
     2015 database read ten years young, and their draft year gives them away; a birth year that fits
     the draft year is the record's own, and the game's own roster has no such records:
     `b.stale_years`).

  Never taken:
  - legends (level ≥ 84);
  - NHL rights holders;
  - anyone younger than `MIN_AGE` (26);
  - free agents;
  - second records of a person;
  - anyone named in the data being applied.

  A skater record may switch position (`Builder.set_position`, which also moves the playing style
  between the defence range 1–4 and the forward range 5–10). `reset_identity()` wipes the previous
  owner: portrait, commentary name, draft and career data, and gives a generic head.
- `placed`, `core_reserve`, `list_rated`, `filled_now`, `pool_released`: bookkeeping across the club
  leagues (see "A club league in detail").
- `maintain`: true when the source already has the 8 formerly empty national teams, meaning
  this tool made it. National teams are then kept, not rebuilt.
- **Idempotency.** Running the build on its own output with the same data produces a
  byte-identical save. Tests enforce it, and every new step must keep it (stable sorting,
  no randomness: `estimate._spread` derives its "random" spread from the player's name).

### Matching people (`matching.py`)

Feed players are matched to records by normalised name (accents and punctuation folded, letters
like ø, æ, ß, ł spelled out: `norm()`) plus birthdate. `match()` (NHL) tolerates nicknames and spelling variants; when several
records share last name and birthdate it requires the first names to agree, so twins do not
collapse into one record. A full-name match needs a birth year within 2 (or ten years late: a
record from the game's own years), and among namesakes the closest birth year wins (0.8.0: the game's own roster has a
Moncton junior Will Smith born 1996, and two Sebastian Ahos). `match_club()` (European clubs) requires the birthdate to agree and
marks records of the game's own years whose birth year is off by ten (`stale`); those get their year fixed and
are re-rated. The DEL gives ages only: full name and birth year, else a short or long form of the
first name (Nico / Nicolas). Ratings-list entries without a birthdate are matched by name among NHL and AHL teams only.

### Ratings for players nobody rates (`estimate.py`)

The ratings list covers the NHL only. A club player's level is "NHL median for his position + league
gap + age + role + a small fixed spread". `LEAGUE_GAP` (per league and position group) and
`AGE_CURVE` were measured on the game's last official roster, which rated every league
it shipped. In the junior leagues age counts relative to 18 (`YOUTH_AGE`), because their gap was
measured on teenagers. The attribute shape (a centre takes face-offs, a defenceman blocks shots)
is the median shape of NHL players at the same position.

### Pictures for players no list gives one

`Builder.former_photos()` (after the pools): a player on a team or the free-agent list without a
photo link gets last season's from the leagues' `former` lists (HockeyTech: last season's rosters of
players on no list now), matched by name and birthdate. Extraliga photos come from each player's
page on hokej.cz (the provider remembers them in `tools/cache/extraliga_photos.json`). A studio
photo on a shaded backdrop (the CHL's, the AHL's) is cut out by growing the backdrop from pixel to
neighbour (`images._shaded_background_mask`) when the plain flood fill fails; only what neither can
cut out is shown in a soft oval. `install.PORTRAIT_DRAWING` redraws installed portraits once when
that changes.

## Safety net: `verify.py`

The game gives no error for a bad roster: it crashes in a menu or silently keeps the previous
roster. `verify(built, source, nhl_players, rebuilt)` re-reads the built save and checks:

- the save reads back and the checksum chain is intact;
- **hard limits**: the team count is unchanged, no team changed league;
- every roster entry points at a player, entry ids are unique;
- with `nhl_players`: every listed player is on exactly his NHL team, nobody else is on one;
- structure (`structure()`): no line slot held twice, dressed exactly when holding a slot, NHL and
  national teams (and every rebuilt club) dress a legal 20 with all slots filled, mirrors equal
  their primary, three letters per NHL team, at most 40 per team, consecutive entry ids, free
  agents listed once and without contracts, draft year, round and pick that fit together;
- contracts point at a team the player is on, and nobody is on two club teams;
- deals the update wrote (`contracts.problems`, with the money scale): cap hit between $0.4M and $20.8M scaled, 1-15
  seasons, an extension with both years and dollars.

Checks are relative to the source: a flaw the source already had is not blamed on the update.
Teams the build rebuilt from scratch (`rebuilt`) are held to the full standard regardless.
`pipeline.update()` installs nothing if any problem is reported. Non-fatal facts go to `info`
(for example AHL teams left short-handed by call-ups).

## Data

### NHL.com, live on every update

- `GET https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/roster/{TEAM}/{season}` for the 32 teams (season like
  `20262027`, falling back to `/current`), cached for 20 minutes in `cache\nhl_<season>.json`.
- Players on the source's NHL teams that no roster lists: `search.d3.nhle.com/api/v1/search/player`
  and `/v1/player/{id}/landing`, cached for 6 hours in `cache\missing_<hash>.json`.
- Offline (`--offline`): the cached copy, else the snapshot in the data pack.

### The data pack (`legacy_roster/data/datapack.json.gz`)

Built by `tools/build_datapack.py`, bundled in the exe, and downloaded fresh from `PACK_URL` (the file server,
`datasource.FILES_URL`, put there by `tools/publish_packs.py`; MAINTAINING.md). Format 2 since 0.32.0. Gzipped JSON:

                               "nhl_contract" (AHL), "birth_approx" (DEL)}]}]},
                "extraliga": {...}, "shl": {...}, "del": {...}, "nl": {...}, "norway": {...},

}
```

Each league also has `extra`: the clubs its feed lists that have no slot (Jokerit, Ajoie, Penticton
...), with their players, for a player's own custom team of that name (`clubs.own_teams`).

```
```

- **Photos and logos.** `photo` and `logo` are links only (or null); the pictures are downloaded on
  the player's PC. Player photos come from each feed; logos from the feed (AHL, CHL, Liiga), else
  from the club's English Wikipedia article (`tools/providers/wiki_logo.py`, which renders SVG
  logos as PNG), else `logo` / `wiki` in `club_slots.json`. NHL logos are ESPN's PNG copies
  (NHL.com has SVG only). NHL photos come live with the NHL.com rosters (`headshot`).

- **League id.** Every team carries its own `league_id`, for two reasons:
  - the CHL spans the game's leagues 9–11;
  - the AHL's Coachella Valley and Henderson sit in custom slots (league 13).
- **Country.** A league's `country` is null where the clubs come from several countries (AHL, CHL). There, a
  player without a country gets none, and nobody counts as an import.
- **Format check.** `datasource.load_pack()` skips a pack whose `format` is newer than `PACK_FORMAT`.
- **In the window.** `sources` feeds the "data from …" line under each switch, and `left_out` the line below it
  (`pipeline.left_out_note`). A league appears as soon as the pack has it (`pipeline.steps_for(pack)`).
  Leagues the game has but the pack lacks are listed as "Coming later" (`pipeline.planned(pack)`).

## The game's own roster (`stock.py`, 0.6.0, experimental)

For players with no community roster (owner, 2026-10-04). The disc's `db/nhlng.db` (in
`cacheboot.big`) holds all 39 tables of a roster save with the same record layout (FORMAT.md
section 6).
- **The source.** `Rpcs3.disc_slots()` lists a `savedata.DiscSlot` per version RPCS3 has the disc
  of (`games.yml`). The window shows it last in the roster list, marked "start fresh". The command
  line takes it as `--source disc`. `find_rpcs3` accepts an RPCS3 with no roster save when the game
  is listed. A roster saved in the game without a community roster has the same layout and is
  accepted too.
- **`from_disc()`** builds the save: the roster tables in the save's order, the game's maxima
  (`ROSTER_MAX`), header flag 6, the `prCe` index on `caBZ`, trailer, wrapper (`tdb.RosterFile.from_db`).
- **`prepare()`** (start of `build()`, `check_base` → `STOCK`; a no-op on its own output, since 30/31
  then hold no All-Star copies):
  - empties the All-Star slots 30/31 (Seattle, Vegas);
  - moves birth years to year − 1910;
  - adds spare "ZZ" records cloned per position, up to the 6,745 players the community roster shows
    the game reads.
- **During the build.** Free agents of `RETIRE_AGE` (30) and older retire unless they played in the
  NHL last season (`settle_free_agents`; before 0.8.0 `prepare` retired them by age alone, and
  Reimer with them). On the first update its 2014 national teams are emptied and filled again
  (`clear_national`): their members were blocking retirements (Datsyuk, Price, Rask stayed free
  agents in 0.7.0).
  - No mirrors (`layout.mirrors(STOCK)` is empty: no custom copies, owner's decision).
  - `pipeline.usable_clubs` leaves out clubs whose slot is a switched-off custom team (Coachella
    Valley and Henderson).
  - Before the leagues, `retire_leftovers()` retires 2014's players of 30 and older whom no feed
    lists, except those a club needs to dress 20. The NHL step retires its leavers the same way.
    Retired players' links are handed out again in place (`Builder.dead_links`). All of this
    happens before any new player is made, so a second run finds no spare record the first did not
    have, and stays byte-identical.
- **In-game check:** `cli stock-test` (ROADMAP).

## Photos and logos (`legacy_roster/art/`, experimental)

A switch in the window ("Photos, logos and team names") and `update --photos` on the command line.
The pictures are made on the player's own PC from templates of his own disc; the program downloads
them already drawn (photo pack, below) together with this season's jerseys and centre-ice logos (look pack, below),
which are put onto the player's own disc files. Neither is inside the exe (0.32.0, `packs.py`).

**Both versions of the game.** The EU (`BLES02153`) and NA (`BLUS31540`) discs hold the same art and
text files, so one set of pictures serves both. `install.install(rpcs3, title_id, ..., also=[...])`
reads the templates from the disc of `title_id` and writes every file into the game folder of each
version (`_Writer` over several folders). The pipeline passes the versions in `targets`.

1. **Before anything is built** `pipeline.Pictures` (one per update or Roster editor save): `install.check()` stops
   with a sentence when RPCS3 is running or RPCS3 does not know where the game is (`config/games.yml`);
   `install.scan_claims()` reads who uses which portrait number on this PC (every roster save of every RPCS3 user,
   every portrait file in the game folders: `portraits.Claims`); `portraits.forget_conflicts()` forgets the registry's
   numbers someone else uses.
2. **During the build** every placed player with a photo link is recorded (`Builder.photos`: the NHL
   step and `clubs.update_league`; the player's own photos also in `Builder.own_photos`), and every club with a logo
   link (`Builder.logos`, `own_logos`). After `finish()`, `install.prefetch()` makes sure each new photo gives a
   picture (drawn into the cache, nothing written to the game); one that does not (no head, no download, NHL.com's
   grey stand-in: `images.stand_in`) is left out and its player keeps the picture he had (`Builder.bad_pictures`).
   Then `portraits.plan()` writes the portrait ids into the roster: one of the game's own ids (1–12,401) or a
   community id (12,402–13,826) stays and its file gets today's photo, unless another person uses it (in this roster
   or another one on this PC: `portraits.same_person` compares name and birthday without the year); anyone else gets
   an id remembered per person in `art\portrait_ids.json` (new ones from 40,000, `FRESH_IDS`), never one someone
   else uses, so a player keeps his id and a build on its own output stays byte-identical. `hasportrait` is set to 1.
   **Own pictures only** (`Pictures(own_only=True)`): with Photos off, an update whose edits hold a photo or a logo
   of the player's own, and the Roster editor's Save, plan and install only those (no names, menus, jerseys, crests,
   masks, pool logos, no give-back).
3. **After the roster is saved** `Pictures.put_in()`: `install.give_back()` takes our files off the numbers that
   were forgotten or that rosters give to more than one person (the kept copy returns, else ours is deleted), then
   `install.install()`:
   - reads templates from the player's disc (`lab.Disc`: portrait p100, each club's own logo files);
   - takes each picture from this PC's cache (`photopack.PictureCache`, `art\pictures\`, keyed by
     the exact link), else from the photo pack, else downloads it (6 at a time), draws it and keeps
     it in the cache. Drawing with Pillow (`images.py`): background removed from studio photos
     (flood fill from the edges), head found (top, middle, width) and placed where the game's own
     portraits have it; logos in the five styles (`t`, `s`, `w`, `c`, `d`), each inside the area the
     disc's own logos of that kind fill (`images.LOGO_BOX`, 0.8.0: before, big logos covered the
     team's record and calendar logos spilled out of their cells), and for the 32 NHL slots the sixth,
     `r` (logo on its reflection, 256×512, the favourite-team screens; `install.logo_kinds`). NHL
     logos come from ESPN in two versions: the plain `500` one for the pictures with a white edge
     (`t`, `d`, `r`; `install.EDGED_KINDS`, `install.plain_logo_url`) and the `500-dark` one for the
     banner, watermark and calendar (`s`, `w`, `c`). The dark ones are white silhouettes for Tampa Bay,
     Washington and Toronto and in part Boston, Vancouver, Los Angeles and Detroit; with the edge they
     came out as white blobs on the favourite-team screen (owner, 2026-10-06; `LOGO_DRAWING` '#3');
   - encodes them (Pillow's DXT5 for portraits, plain 32-bit for logos) into a copy of the template
     (`bigf.ArtFile.with_image`) and writes them as loose files (portraits in `p0_4000`,
     `p4001_8000` or `p8001_12000`);
   - backs up any file it replaces and lists every file with its link in `art\installed.json`,
     per game folder (`{'games': {folder: {file: {'source', 'backup', 'stamp'}}}}`; version 0.4's
     single `{'game_dir', 'files'}` is read too). A file already made from the same link is skipped;
     a logo's source carries the drawing version too (`install.LOGO_DRAWING`), so a new way of
     drawing redraws every installed logo once.
     Rules for the copies (`_Writer.write`, `_keep`, `ours`):
     - a kept copy is never overwritten by one of the program's own files (after a lost
       `installed.json` the file there is ours, and the original stays);
     - `stamp` (size, time) tells our file from one put there later, for example another picture
       pack: that one is copied aside first and comes back with "Restore";
     - `remove()` leaves a file it did not write and has no copy of.
   A failed download leaves the player with his old picture or the silhouette; the List of changes
   names him under "Pictures not installed" (`pipeline.note_skipped`, 0.8.0).
4. **Team names** (`portraits.names()`, `install.install_names()`, `loc.py`).
   - For every rebuilt club, NHL slots 22/30/31 (Utah, Seattle, Vegas) and every team the player
     renamed, the art code's five name keys are written into each language's text file.
   - A custom team shows only the text under its `shortname`. The update writes custom shortnames
     as keys in the game's own style (`layout.city_key`: COACHELLA_VALLEY, 2026_PROSPECTS_2;
     `pools.relocate`, the club step, team edits, and `portraits.names()` for older rosters and
     the Kings copy's "NhlCityName_13" → LOS_ANGELES). Each gets the team's full name as its text,
     unless the game already has one (ANAHEIM). Keys added to the text file keep their case
     (`loc.LocFile.set`): texts added under capitalised keys did not show in the game.
   - The files are always made from the disc's originals, so nothing piles up across updates. They
     are listed in `installed.json` like the pictures.
   - The prospect pools in the spare custom slots get art ids of their own (21000 + slot) and logos:
     the NHL team's for a "System" pool, `images.badge()` with the year for a draft class.
5. **Undo** (`install.remove()`: the Photos row's Restore or "Restore default" with the next save, `cli photos remove`;
   the classic window's "Restore the game's own pictures") restores every backup,
   deletes the files it added and the folders it made, in every game folder. Rosters are not
   changed: ids without a file show the silhouette.

Pillow is the only package outside the standard library the engine uses, and only here
(`images.py`, imported when the switch is on).

**The photo pack** (owner's decision, 2026-10-03: players should not each download everything).
- **Building it:** `tools/build_photopack.py` downloads every linked photo and logo once, draws them
  with `images.py` and stores the results as WebP in `private/packs/photos.zip`:
  - portraits: the top 512×256 of the big picture and the 256×128 small one;
  - logos: trimmed, at most 512 px.
- **Keys and index:** `index.json` maps a key to its file. The key is the link itself, or `nhl:<id>`
  for NHL.com headshots, whose links change with the season.
- **Shipping** (0.32.0): not inside any exe. `tools/publish_packs.py` puts it on the file server; `packs.py` downloads
  it (and the look pack) into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NHLLegacyRosterUpdater\packs\` while the Photos switch is on:
  `manifest()` reads `manifest.json` (per pack `file`, `size`, `sha256`, `built`), `fetch()` streams to `.part`,
  checks size and SHA-256 and renames to `<name>-<sha12>.zip` (a pack open on Windows is never replaced; `prune()` removes
  the old one at the next start), `path(name)` gives the complete pack, `LEGACY_ROSTER_PACKS` a dev folder. The window
  (`UpdateController.download_pictures`) starts it at start and when the switch goes on; an update waits for a running
  download. Git ignores the packs (`private/`).
- **At run time:** `art/photopack.py` opens `packs.path('photos')`. `install.make_portrait` / `make_logo` take pictures
  from the cache first, then from the pack. Only links missing from both are downloaded.

**Jerseys and centre ice** (`art/looks.py`, `art/rpsgl.py`, installed with the photos by `pipeline.install_looks`).
- `looks.looks_from(R, edits, ..., look_pack=)` gives one `Look` per team to make, in one loop over Utah / Seattle / Vegas
  (drawn from the colours on the Utah chassis), every team of any league with the Roster editor's choices (`edits.json`
  `uniforms` / `ice`, only where `looks.editable`) and every team of the look pack (`art/lookpack.py`,
  `looks.zip`, downloaded by `packs.py`, made in `private/`, not in git). A `Look` is keyed by the
  team's **art id** (`looks.team_art`: Charlotte is slot 36, art 162), never the slot.
- A pack team goes to a slot only when the slot holds it (`LookPack.holds`: NHL slots always, a national team by its
  short name, a club by its name in the roster); its kits go onto the home and away versions only (`looks.pack_versions`:
  the dark / light default; owner 2026-10-18: thirds stay the game's own), in the team's cut (`looks.art_style`: style 1
  NHL / AHL / CHL, style 0 most European clubs and the national teams).
- The editor offers every NHL version but only home and away elsewhere (`looks.team_versions`). A team that wears
  another team's art (Winter Classic, EASHL, Top Prospects) is changed at that team (`looks.jersey_owner`): the window
  opens there (`looks.window_team`). "From the colours" needs the shared layout (`Maker.standard`, never style 0); "My
  picture" in style 0 goes the way of the pack's kits (`Maker.cut_files`). A club's new centre ice goes on only where its
  home games show its own file (`looks.own_ice`), else the List of changes says "Centre ice not installed". Where a
  group of teams shares one centre-ice file (national teams 501, DEL 197, EASHL 255: `looks.ice_group`), a picture is
  the group's: the lowest slot with one wins, the window keeps it on one member. Club logos for the drawn looks come
  from the data pack's leagues (`looks.club_logos`), then `b.logos`.
- **Custom teams 222-251** have no jersey files: the game draws them like Create a Team teams (`custom_kit.py`: design
  numbers in `ttOk`, colours in `NDEo`, the crest = a create-a-team logo by art id). Their edits are roster data
  (edits.json `kit`, `edits._team_kit` → `custom_kit.write`, in `apply_teams` before the gear steps); only a crest
  picture is a file (`art/crests.py`, onto a logo no other team wears, `custom_kit.free_logo`). The window is
  `app/teamkit.py` with the game's own Create a Team menu pictures.
- `looks.Maker` writes each version's own disc file with the new colour map (relief and shine flattened, or style 0's
  median relief), the number sheet recoloured, pants / socks / menu picture (style 1), the centre-ice logo. Files go in as
  loose files through `art/install._Writer` (kept copies, Restore); `look_digest` makes a changed look install again.

## Roster editor and the player's edits (`editor/`, `edits.py`)

**In the window** (0.50.0) the Roster editor is the six team tabs (Roster, Lines, Strategy, Jerseys & ice, Calendar,
Front office; section "The window"), run by `app/editor.EditorController` and its followers. The classic window had two
tabs (`gui.App.tabs`): **Update** and **Roster editor** (`editor/view.EditorTab`); what follows holds for both.

**What the editor shows.**
- `editor/model.Snapshot` reads a roster save into teams (by league) and players: position,
  number, age, country, overall and ratings.
  - The overall is the mean of the game's attributes plus an offset (`ratings.overall_offset`), so
    it is close to the game's own figure, not identical.
  - Players are matched across rosters by person (`edits.who_of`: plain name + birthdate).
- `model.compare(before, after, team)` gives each team's joined, left and changed players. It
  colours the table against the roster as it was opened (so only this visit's edits show).
- `model.apply_edits(raw, edits, teams, season)` builds the roster with edits and no update step.

**The view.** One: the roster save picked in Setup (classic window: on the Update tab) as it is (`EditorTab.view`, with the file's size
and time in `source`, so a changed file is read again) plus the edits made in this visit (`session`,
`session_teams`; `apply_edits` with no update step, about 2 s). The edits kept in `edits.json` (`self.edits`)
are applied by every update (the Update tab's "My edits"), not shown over a roster that was saved with
them. (Until 0.8.0 there was an "As is" and a "To be" view: a dry run of the update, removed 2026-10-06.)
**Saving** follows the Update tab's choice (`UpdateController.set_save_mode`; classic window `App.save_mode`):
`savedata.update_in_place` (expected = the
bytes read when the roster was opened) or a new save (`savedata.install`); the game's own roster is always
a new save.
- **The picture on the card** (`editor/pictures.py`, Pillow): the player's own picture if he has
  one; else what the game shows now for his
  `artid` (the loose file in RPCS3's game folder, else the disc's own file). Made in a thread; a
  token drops a late result for a player no longer shown.
- Worker threads hand results back through `App.queue` as `('ui', callable)`.

**Edits** (`edits.py`).
- **Storage.** Kept in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NHLLegacyRosterUpdater\edits.json`, one entry per person:
  - `set` fields;
  - `ratings` by attribute name;
  - `team` (a slot or `FA`);
  - `new` for a created player (with `ovr`);
  - `was`, the original name and birthdate.
- **Where they run.** `pipeline.build(my_edits=...)` runs them in two places:
  1. `edits.restore()` right after parsing: renamed players get their original names back, so the
     update still recognises them;
  2. `edits.apply()` as the last step before `contracts()`.
- **What `apply()` does.** It finds each person, sets fields and ratings, and moves or releases
  him:
  - at most 40 a team;
  - an edited number wins a clash;
  - goalies stay goalies;
  - a new player takes a spare record through `donors`.

  It then deals the lines of changed teams afresh (`lines.build_lines`; letters kept where the
  holders stay, `clubs._letters`) and syncs the mirrors.
- **The safety check.** `verify(edited=...)` lets the edited players differ from NHL.com's rosters,
  and only them.
- **Determinism.** A build on its own output with the same edits is byte-identical
  (`tests/test_edits.py`).
- **Who applies them.** The Update tab's "My edits" switch and `cli update --edits` apply them to
  every update.
- **Team edits and pictures of the player's own.**
  - `edits.json` also holds `teams`: `{slot: {full, city, abbr, logo}}`, applied by
    `edits.apply_teams` (team table names, `Builder.team_names`, `Builder.logos`).
  - A player edit may carry `photo`, and `contract` (the Front office's contract window; section "The window",
    "Contract edits").
  - Chosen pictures are copied to `art\mine\` (`edits.keep_picture`) and used as `file:` links by
    `install._download`.
- **Records for new players** (`'new player records'` experimental). With every league on, the leagues use every spare
  record, so `edits.records_needed` counts the new players not in the roster yet and `Builder.hold_records` takes their
  records right after the free agents are reserved; `_create` takes a held record first, and records held but not
  needed go back. The leagues lose their last depth players instead (the report's "skipped" list).
- **An NHL player with no record left** (0.50.1). On an update of a fully updated roster no spare record is left, so
  an NHL.com newcomer (or a national-team player, `required=True`) would stop the update. `Builder.take_record` then
  calls `make_room`: the least needed free agent of the same kind retires (`retires(force=True)`), else a CHL club with
  more than 2 G / 18 skaters of that kind gives up its weakest single-record player without NHL rights ("left to make
  room"). Both are deterministic, so a build of its own output stays byte-identical.
- **Draft classes** (`draftclass.py`, `'draft classes'` experimental; lab round 44). A class player is a new player
  with a `prospect` block (`class`, `tier`, `potential`) on a European or CHL club (`DRAFT_SLOTS`: the clubs a new Be a
  GM imports prospects from; the AHL and the free-agent list are not draft sources). `draftclass.apply` runs after the
  last `draft.apply` (which would give a made-up namesake a real draft): potential fitted into the growth tier's band
  (`TIER_BANDS`, as a new career fits it), growth tier and letter, draft fields "undrafted" with the eligible year
  (`eligible_year`, 18 by 15 September). It returns `b.prospects`; `verify(prospects=)` runs `draftclass.problems`. A
  class player on another club, or born outside the next four drafts, is left as he is and named in the report.
  Classes play their part only in the patched game (a career counts years from the patched game's year).
- **The Draft & Pro tab** (`app/prospects.py` `ProspectsController`, slice `prospects`; `web/js/prospects.js`). A
  follower of the team list like the other team tabs, but the page shows its own list there (`ClassRail`: the next
  four drafts and My pro). It has no card of its own: Add / pick open the Roster editor's card (`EditorController.
  new_player(preset, extra)`: a filled card whose edit gets `extra` on Apply; `open_person(key)`: a player of My edits,
  joined to this visit's edits if the shown roster lacks him), so Apply, Undo, the checks and the Save bar are the
  editor's. What is typed on the card is shared by both tabs (`editor.js` `useCardForm`). The controller lists class
  players by `eligible_year`, says whether each is in the roster, waiting (made in an earlier visit) or left out (not on
  a draft club), sets `prospect` `tier` / `potential` (on a new card through `new_extra`, before Apply), and keeps one
  `pro`. The room line counts the shown build's spare records (`donors.left`).
- **Class files and the random maker** (`draftclass.py`, P3). A class file is JSON (`"format": "legacy-roster-draft-class",
  "version": 1`, name, year, players: the card's values as typed, the prospect block, the club as league + name; no
  pictures); `read_class` refuses anything else in plain words. Import (`ProspectsController.import_text`) moves birth
  dates to the class shown (`shift_birth`), finds each club by league and name (else one of the same league, else a
  junior club: `spread`), skips names the roster or My edits has, and lists what it did in a report window. `make(year,
  count, names, clubs, seed, strength, taken)` is seeded from all its inputs (the same number makes the same class):
  tiers by strength (`tiers_for`, best first), country and position by recent drafts' shares (`COUNTRY_MIX`,
  `POSITION_MIX`), a European player in his country's league (`HOME_LEAGUE`), first and last names from different
  players of that country (the controller passes players outside the NHL only, and every full name of the roster as
  `taken`), births across `birth_window`, overall from the potential. Made and imported players go through the card's
  checks (`card.read`, `new_player`) and wear a free number on their club. Both refuse a class the spare records cannot
  hold (`_no_room`). The maker's line survives the rebuild (`EditorController.next_note`).
- **A new player's record** starts without the last wearer's deal (`edits._create` clears `contracts.FIELDS` and the
  status): his club's starter deal or an NHL deal follows. A Save without update steps fits the contract status of the
  players the edits moved or made (`pipeline.build`: `touched`), not only of the contracts edited.

## Team layout of the supported roster

The game has 252 team slots in 16 leagues, all fixed (`layout.py`, FORMAT.md section 6). The
updater supports the community roster family: the 2025-26 roster ("ROSTER2526"), the community's
2026-27 roster (the same layout; its custom copies out of step, six national teams emptied, 25 more
player records) and the rosters made from them. Since 0.6.0 it also supports the game's own layout
(section "The game's own roster": real 2014 clubs everywhere, All-Star teams in 30/31, custom
slots off). `check_base()` refuses anything else.

| League (id) | Slots | What the base roster has there | Updater |
|---|---|---|---|
| NHL (0) | 0–31 | 32 teams; slot 22 holds Utah, the All-Star slots 30/31 hold Seattle and Vegas | `nhl` step, live |
| AHL (1) | 32–61 (+ custom 234, 235) | 32 teams, incomplete lines | `ahl` (experimental) |
| SHL (2) | 62–75 | 62–67 prospect pools "2026–2031 Prospects 1", 68–75 eight empty club slots | `shl` (experimental) |
| Liiga (3) | 76–90 | 76–79 prospect pools, 80–90 empty club slots | `liiga` |
| DEL (4) | 91–104 | 91–93 prospect pools, 94–100 empty club slots, 101–104 NHL "System" pools | `del` (experimental) |
| Extraliga (5) | 105–118 | 14 NHL "System" pools | `extraliga` |
| National League (6) | 119–130 | 12 NHL "System" pools | `nl` (experimental) |
| Norway (7) | 131–132 | 131 USNTDP Juniors, 132 Vålerenga (empty) | `norway` (experimental) |
| National (8) | 133–153 | 13 squads, 8 empty (AUT, BLR, GBR, JPN, KAZ, NOR, POL, UKR) | `national` |

| Custom (13) | 222–251 | 222–233 mirrors of 12 NHL teams; 234/235 AHL Coachella Valley and Henderson; 236–251 sixteen spare slots, switched off | mirrors synced; spare slots receive relocated pools |

The slot sets are constants in `layout.py`:
- league slots: `SHL`, `LIIGA`, `DEL`, `EXTRALIGA`, `NL`, `NORWAY`, `EUROPE`, `OHL`, `QMJHL`, `WHL`, `CHL`;
- other slots: `EVENTS`, `SPARE`, `SYSTEM_POOL_SLOTS`;
- `AHL_PARENT_EXTRA`: the NHL parents of the two AHL teams in custom slots.

Every pool slot keeps its original art abbreviation (for example `VF` for Frölunda, `HCAP` for
Ambri). Those come from the stock team table on the game disc (`db/nhlng.db` in `cacheboot.big`).

**Prospect pools.**
1. When a league gets its real clubs, displaced pool players move to a spare custom slot named
   after their pool (`pools.relocate`).
2. While the leagues are built, a pool slot may hold more than 40: the AHL and CHL steps still take
   their players out of the pools.
3. Then `pools.settle()` keeps the best 40 per slot, moves the overflow to pools with room, and
   makes the rest free agents.

With every league on, all 16 spare slots are used.

## Finding RPCS3 and the saves (`savedata.py`)

- `find_rpcs3(path)` accepts `rpcs3.exe`, its folder, or any folder inside it (version 0.1
  remembered the save folder). `dev_hdd0` comes from `config\vfs.yml` (or `vfs.yml`) with
  `$(EmulatorDir)` resolved, else `<rpcs3>\dev_hdd0`. The user is `[Users] active_user` from
  `GuiConfigs\persistent_settings.dat` (or `CurrentSettings.ini`), else the user with the newest
  roster. Failures raise `Rpcs3Error` with a sentence for the player.
- `running_rpcs3()` finds a running `rpcs3.exe` through the process list (Windows API, no extra
  package); the window uses it to fill in Setup's "Where is RPCS3?" and to hide "Start RPCS3".
- `find_savedata(path)` (command line `--savedata`) accepts a roster folder, the savedata folder or
  anything above it.
- A roster save is a folder `<TITLEID>02NN` whose `SYS-DATA` starts with `PS3RosterFile`.
  `Slot.tool_made` recognises this tool's saves by their name (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`).
- **Versions.** `GAMES` = {`BLES02153`: EU, `BLUS31540`: NA}; `Slot.region`; `Rpcs3.games()` lists
  the versions RPCS3 has (in `games.yml` or with saves). Both read the same `SYS-DATA`; their
  `PARAM.SFO` differs only in `TITLE` (`TITLES`) and the folder name, so `install(title_id=...)`
  saves a roster for the other version.
  `next_free()` takes the lowest free number 01-09: the game lists only the first 10 roster folders of a version by name
  (`GAME_LISTS`); with 10 folders in use, or 01-09 taken, it raises `RosterFull` (the window greys "Make new roster",
  `pipeline.update` checks every Save-for version before building). `roster_count` / `hidden_in_game` feed Setup's
  count and the "not in the game" mark (`UpdateController._room`), and `cli list`.
  `clean_name()` keeps names to characters the game's font has, at most 40.

## What the program writes on the user's PC

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `…\savedata\<TITLEID>02NN\` | A new roster save per update and version saved for, or (the default since 2026-10-06) the picked roster's `SYS-DATA` replaced in place (`savedata.update_in_place`: backup first, written next to the save folder and moved over the old file, never while RPCS3 runs, only a roster save directly in `savedata`, not the game's own roster). Nothing else in `savedata` is ever written or changed. The only removal is the window's **Delete** button on a roster save: a move to the Recycle Bin / Trash (`savedata.trash_save`; never while RPCS3 runs, never a folder that is not a roster save in that folder, never permanent) |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NHLLegacyRosterUpdater\backups\<TITLEID>02NN_<time>\` | The old `ICON0.PNG`, `PARAM.SFO`, `SYS-DATA` of a roster before it was updated in place (the newest 10 per roster are kept; never inside `savedata`: the game lists every folder that starts like a roster save) |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NHLLegacyRosterUpdater\settings.json` | Path of `rpcs3.exe` (`rpcs3`), switch positions (`steps`) |
| `…\cache\` | `nhl_<season>.json`, `missing_<hash>.json`, a downloaded `datapack.json.gz` |
| `…\reports\` | The list of changes per update, as a page and a CSV (`<folder>_<time>.html` / `.csv`, `failed_…`, `dryrun_…`) |
| `…\logs\error.log` | Tracebacks of unexpected errors, for bug reports |
| `…\edits.json` | The player's own edits from the Roster editor |
| `…\art\portrait_ids.json` | Photos and logos: the portrait id given to each person on this PC |
| `…\art\installed.json`, `…\art\backup\` | Photos and logos: every picture file written (with the link it was made from) and a copy of any file it replaced |
| `…\art\pictures\` | Photos and logos: every picture this PC downloaded, drawn (the photo pack's layout), so none is downloaded twice |
| `<dev_hdd0>\game\<TITLEID>\USRDIR\fe\ion\artassets\…` | Photos and logos only (switch on, RPCS3 closed): loose picture files the game reads before its disc. "Restore the game's own pictures" puts back every file as it was |

## The window (0.10: `window/`, `app/`, `web/`; nine tabs since 0.50.0)

The 0.9 window (CustomTkinter) tore and redrew while it was moved or resized. Since 0.10 the window is a web page in
a native window: pywebview serves `legacy_roster/web/` over its local http server (ES modules do not load from
`file://`) to Edge WebView2 (Windows) or WebKit (Mac, Linux).

```
 web/ (React 18 + htm, no build step)         window/                        app/ (no window toolkit)
   main.js (the tabs)  update.js  rail.js ◄── host.py: WebHost pushes   ◄──  UpdateController   (update.py)
   editor.js  calendar.js  office.js          window.LR.receive({slices,      EditorController   (editor.py)
   ui.js  shell.js  store.js  lib.js          log, events}) at most 25 Hz     Uniforms / Equipment / Lines / Strategy /
   bridge.js ── call('x', …) ───────────────► api.py: Api methods  ────────►  Calendar / Office controllers,
                                                                              SeasonSource (season.py), jobs, settings, texts
```

- **Python holds all state; the page only shows it.** Each controller has `snapshot()` → a JSON "slice". The slices,
  registered in `window/main.py` with `host.register`: `update`, `editor`, `picture`, `face_pics`, `uniforms`, `thumbs`,
  `equipment`, `equip_pics`, `lines`, `strategy`, `rail` (`EditorController.rail_view`), `calendar`, `office`,
  `contract` (`OfficeController.contract_snapshot`). After a change a controller calls `host.changed(name)`; the pusher
  thread sends the newest snapshot of each changed slice in one `evaluate_js` per tick (25 Hz at most, the latest wins),
  so a burst of engine messages costs one repaint. The page keeps the slices in `store.js` (`useSlice`).
- **Calls** go `bridge.call(name, …)` → `window.pywebview.api.<name>` (`window/api.py`). Errors are logged to error.log
  and returned as `{error}`, never raised into the page. pywebview runs each call on its own thread: every controller has an
  `RLock`. Lock order: a follower (below) may take `editor.lock` while it holds its own, never the other way round
  (`EditorController._followers_now` is never called with the editor's lock held; `uniforms.lock` before `editor.lock`
  as before); the update controller never takes the editor's.
- **Long jobs** (`app/jobs.py`) run in a thread and report through the controller; the update's engine messages feed
  `progress.fraction` exactly as before (**the wording of engine messages is still an interface**).
- **Pictures** (portraits, logos, jersey thumbnails) go to the page as `data:` WebP links (`app/dataurl.py`) in their own
  slices, with a request token so only the latest asked-for picture is shown.

**Nine tabs in one row** (`web/js/main.js` `TABS`, 0.50.0, the owner's wish). They replaced the two tabs Update / Roster
editor and the Lines, Strategies and Jerseys and ice windows that opened on top of the editor:

| Tab | Page | Controller (slice) |
|---|---|---|
| Setup: card 1 where is RPCS3, card 2 which roster (Open folder / Delete per roster, the "7 of 10" counts), Downloads, This program | `update.js` `SetupTab` | `UpdateController` (`update`) |
| Update: what should be updated (the gold Photos row first, Restore, Restore default), Save (update in place / as new, Save for), the result | `update.js` `UpdateTab` | `UpdateController` (`update`) |
| Game patch: Patch / Unpatch, the two switches, a card per version (EU, NA), "What the game patch does" | `update.js` `PatchTab` | `UpdateController` (`update`, its `patch` part) |
| Roster | `editor.js` `RosterTab` | `EditorController` (`editor`, `picture`) |
| Lines | `editor.js` `LinesTab` | `LinesController` (`lines`) |
| Strategy | `editor.js` `StrategyTab` | `StrategyController` (`strategy`) |
| Jerseys & ice | `editor.js` `JerseysTab` | `UniformsController` (`uniforms`, `thumbs`) |
| Calendar | `calendar.js` `CalendarTab` | `CalendarController` (`calendar`) |
| Front office | `office.js` `OfficeTab`, `ContractWindow` | `OfficeController` (`office`, `contract`) |

- A tab is drawn on its first visit, then kept (hidden). Keys (`main.js`): Ctrl+1..9 open a tab, Ctrl+PgUp / Ctrl+PgDn
  the tab on the left / right, Alt+Up / Alt+Down the team before / after (`rail_step`), Ctrl+S Save, D the details. Old
  tab names still open the new tab (`OLD_NAMES`: `editor`, `uniforms`, `strategies`). The page tells Python which tab
  shows: `Api.tab(name)` → `EditorController.show_tab(tab)`.
- **The six team tabs share one team list** (`web/js/rail.js` `Rail`, drawn once outside the panes so it keeps its
  scroll; slice `rail`): the league (`rail_league` → `set_league`), its teams with a code chip in their colours, the pick
  (`rail_team` → `pick_team`; the pick stays across tabs) and one number per team that fits the tab (`RAIL_TIPS`:
  players; games from `CalendarController.rail_numbers`; cap space from `OfficeController.rail_numbers`), a mark on
  teams with changes not applied yet (a follower's `drafts()`), and an AHL club's parent.
- **One Save bar** (`editor.js` `SaveBar`) under every team tab but the Calendar: My edits, Update this roster / Save as
  a new roster (`EditorController.set_save_mode` → the Update tab's own choice), Save (Ctrl+S, `editor_save`).
- **Followers.** `EditorController` owns the picked roster, league and team (the Roster tab is the editor itself). Each
  other team-tab controller registers with `editor.follow_with(tab, self)`: `LinesController` ('lines'),
  `StrategyController` ('strategy'), `UniformsController` ('jerseys'), `CalendarController` ('calendar'),
  `OfficeController` ('office'). A follower has `follow(team)`, `hide()`, `roster_changed()` and `snapshot()`, plus
  `drafts()` and `rail_numbers()` where it has them. `show_tab(tab)` reads the roster picked in Setup when a team tab
  opens (`opened()`), then `_followers_now()`: after a roster was read again (an edit, a save, another roster) every
  follower gets `roster_changed()` and drops what it kept for teams (`roster_key()` says which roster); the follower of
  the tab in view gets `follow(team)`, all others `hide()`. So only the visible tab does work, and a draft not applied
  yet stays with its team when another team is picked. The Roster card's "Contract..." goes through
  `EditorController.contract_open`, which makes the office follow the player's club first.
- **In-page windows** (`Modal`, in the look of the game's "Help" box): questions (Delete, Restore default, close while
  busy), on the Roster tab Team, My edits, Face of a player and Equipment (`EditorModals`), and the Front office's
  contract window (`ContractWindow`). File pickers are the system's (`host.ask_open` / `ask_save`).
- **Player card**: the form lives in the page and is sent with Apply, Save (`editor_save(card)`) and a player pick
  (`editor_player(id, card)`) only when it was changed; the controller checks it with `editor/card.py` (shared with the
  old window) and bumps `card.key` to reset the form.

**Calendar** (`app/calendar.py`, `web/js/calendar.js`). A `Book` per roster read: the NHL's games (`nhlschedule`: the
real 2026-27 calendar after an update with the calendar step, else the game's own 2015-16 one), the All-Star game (shown,
counted for nobody) and, on a game-patch roster, the AHL's (`schedule.read_ahl`). A month page Monday to Sunday with the
team's games ("vs" home, "@" away) or every game (`mode` 'team' / 'league'), a day's games, the team's games by month.
Calls: `calendar_month`, `calendar_day`, `calendar_today`, `calendar_mode`, `calendar_season` (the "My season" switch).

**Front office** (`app/office.py`, `web/js/office.js`; the engine part is `frontoffice.py`, no window code).
`frontoffice.Index` reads who is where once (players by team, the free-agent list, the rights each NHL team holds, the
farm clubs); `org` gives an organisation's NHL roster, farm and prospects with each deal (`contracts.deal_of`);
`seasons` / `cap_space` what the NHL roster commits against each season's cap for five seasons (2026-27 to 2030-31,
`gamepatch.CAP_TABLE`). Amounts are real dollars on either money scale (`contracts.real`); the unpatched game shows them
scaled to its $71.4M cap. Calls: `office_sort`, `office_group`; the contract window `contract_open`, `contract_change`,
`contract_apply`, `contract_reset`, `contract_close`.

**Contract edits** (experimental `'contract edits'`, not seen in the game yet). Apply in the contract window →
`EditorController.contract_edit(key, deal)` keeps `{"cap", "years", "two_way", "ext": [years, cap, two_way] | null}` (real
dollars) in edits.json `players[key]['contract']`. `pipeline.build` runs `edits.apply_contracts(b, my_edits)` after
`b.contracts()` and `real_contracts()` (the real deals would replace them otherwise), written on the roster's money scale
(`contracts.write`, `b.money`); a deal the game cannot hold (`contracts.edit_problems`) or a player with no NHL
organisation (`contracts.organisation`: on no NHL roster, nobody's rights) is skipped and named in the List of changes.
`verify(contract_edits=)` runs `verify.contract_edit_problems`: the roster holds exactly that deal, the deal is allowed,
the player has an organisation.

**The player's Season and Be a GM saves** (read only). `seasonsave.py` finds them (`find(savedata, title_ids)`: folders
`<TITLE>10NN` Season, `<TITLE>01NN` Be a GM, an `A` at the end for the autosaves) and reads one into memory
(`read(save)` → `Season`: the schedule with results, the records, the standings, today, the player's team). It never
writes, and leaves a save alone that was written in the last `SETTLE` seconds or changes while it is read (the game may
still be saving). `app/season.py` `SeasonSource` is made once in `window/main.py` and given to the Calendar and the
Office: the newest readable save of the picked roster's game version, read again when its files change; `switch(on)` is
the "My season" switch; an unpatched game's seasons count from 2015 and are moved to this program's (`OFFSET`); whatever
goes wrong becomes a note in plain words, never an error. With it on, the Calendar shows results, today, the next game
and the playoffs, and the Front office the record, place and standings.

- **Look**: tokens in `web/css/tokens.css` (stadium blue, accent `#2597c9`), `teams.css` for the team tabs, Titillium
  Web (`web/fonts`, OFL), the Puck Peak logo `web/img/logo.png` (made with the other brand files by
  `packaging/make_assets.py`). Motion uses transform and opacity only; `?still` and `prefers-reduced-motion` turn it off.
- **Start** (`window/main.py`): checks the unpacked files and WebView2 (`window/webview2.py`, registry); if WebView2,
  pywebview or the start fails, the classic window opens instead (logged in error.log), else a plain message. Windows 11
  gets a dark title bar in the panels' colour (DWM). `python -m legacy_roster --classic` opens the old window on purpose.
  The window opens big and centred (`fit`); it can be made no smaller than 940 x 640 (`MIN_SIZE`).
- **Offline page** (`?demo` / `?fixture=`, `js/demo.js`; `window.__FIXTURE__`): the page without Python, used by
  `tools/window_shot.py` (headless Edge) and for design work in a normal browser (`--browser`).

## The classic window, 0.9 (`gui.py`, `widgets.py`, `theme.py`; kept in 0.10.x as the fallback, to delete in 0.11)

- **Layout**: header (Puck Peak logo, title line, glow line); cards 1 RPCS3 (rosters found per
  version), 2 roster list (each row with the flag of its version; the game's own roster last),
  3 switches, 4 name + "Save for" (EU · NA · EU + NA with flags, only when RPCS3 has both versions;
  `App.save_targets`) + "Update roster"; result banner; footer with progress bar, status line and
  "Details" (the log, cleared at each start). Built from the components in `widgets.py` (`Card`,
  `Chip`, `Choice`, `PrimaryButton`, `GhostButton`, `RosterRow`, `SwitchRow`, `Banner`).
- **Flags**: `widgets.flag_image()` draws the EU and US flags with Pillow (at 4×, shown through
  `CTkImage`): Windows has no flag emoji and Tk draws no colour emoji. Without Pillow the chips show
  text only.
- **Few redraws** (the owner saw flicker and slow repaints):
  - `set_rpcs3` reads and checks the saves in a thread, and caches the checks by (path, size,
    time); only the latest scan may update the window;
  - `list_rosters` keeps rows that did not change (`RosterRow.shows`) and reorders them in place;
  - selection redraws only the previous and newly selected rows;
  - `refresh_state` changes only what changed (`widgets.configure_if_changed`, `App.set_status`;
    options set through that helper must not be set with `configure()` elsewhere);
  - `poll` shows everything the engine said since the last look in one go;
  - at the start of an update the last result stays, dimmed (`Banner.dim`), so the window does not
    shrink and grow again;
  - the editor builds its rating fields once per kind.
- **Look**: `theme.py` holds Puck Peak's colours as tokens (page `#0b1318`, accent `#2596be`;
  Tk has no transparency, so translucent colours are written out blended), loads the bundled
  Source Sans 3 (Segoe UI if that fails) and picks the logo size for the screen scaling.
- **State**: `App.refresh_state()` is the one place that enables or disables controls and sets the
  idle status text; call it after anything that changes what is possible.
- **Settings**: the RPCS3 path is saved when found; switch positions when an update starts.
  Version 0.1's `folder` setting is still read.
- **Size**: 1000 wide, 640–730 tall depending on the screen (`theme.screen_height()` uses
  `GetSystemMetrics` because the program is DPI-aware). The banner and the details panel make the
  window taller (`App.resize()`, by the difference when the banner changes) as far as the screen
  allows; on small screens the two lists scroll instead.
- **Progress**: `progress.py` maps engine messages to a fraction with a table of regular
  expressions. **The wording of engine messages is an interface**: rename a message and the bar
  stalls. `tests/test_progress.py` replays the messages of a real update.
- **CustomTkinter details**: `bind()` on a CTk widget binds its inner canvas and label, so the
  outer widget's own `<Configure>` needs `tk.Frame.bind(widget, …)`. Font sizes are scaled by
  the screen scaling; `theme.text_width()` measures text the same way (used to shorten the
  RPCS3 path in the middle). Scrolling the roster list to the selection uses
  `CTkScrollableFrame._parent_canvas` (private; re-check after upgrading CustomTkinter).

## The game patch (`gamepatch.py`, lab only so far)

Besides the roster, the program can make an **RPCS3 game patch** for the EU game: the year 2026 and 32 NHL teams in Season /
Be a GM. docs/GAME_PATCH.md is its hand-over. It has three parts that only work together:
1. Patch entries for RPCS3 (`gamepatch.patch_text`: the year entry, `TEAM_STAGES`): words RPCS3 changes in the game's memory
   at boot. The EBOOT is never changed.
2. The game's database description and database made for 32 teams (`fit_meta`, `fit_db` from the player's own disc),
   written as loose files into the game folder (store `patch`, its own list and kept copies).
3. A roster made for it: `year_shift`, the 32-team calendar, `farm_fit` (the AHL of 32 and its calendar), `divisions_fit`, checked by
   `verify(farm_patch=True)`.

`cli team32-test` (`calendartest.team32_test`) makes parts 2 and 3 and the lab's patch file. For players: the
window's Game patch tab (`UpdateController.patch`, `cli game-patch install`) runs `patchinstall.install_patch`, which writes part 1
(only our lines of `patch_config.yml` change, a copy is kept) and part 2 (its next-season calendars from
`patchinstall.calendar_roster`, made from the disc). `pipeline.update` then follows RPCS3 (`patchinstall.patched_titles`
for the versions saved for): patched, it builds with the calendar and AHL steps, unshifts a patch roster first
(`gamepatch.unshift`; the first patch build mends the game's own birth years, `mend_years`, so a second run is byte-identical),
switches on Coachella Valley / Henderson on the game's own roster, gives the players' rights six bits so Henderson's
players hold Vegas's (`gamepatch.rights_wide`, `rights_fit`; patch 0.23), makes part 3 (`patch_roster`) and checks it,
and `refresh_db` brings part 2 up to date (the window marks a patch roster whose rights' bits differ from the installed
`db/nhlng-meta.xml`: `UpdateController.misfit`, `patchinstall.installed_rights`); not patched, a patch roster is turned back first (`gamepatch.unpatch_roster` with the game's own roster).
`patchinstall.set_switches` changes only the intro / login entries; `patchinstall.state` tells the window what to show.
That includes the version RPCS3 runs (`game_version`: 01.00, or 01.01 when the update's `USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN` is there)
and `stale` when the patch is in but not for that version (the window's "Patch again"). The patch text carries a 1.01
block for both titles (`gamepatch.UPDATE_HASH`, `legacy_roster/patch101.py`).
`patchinstall.remove` (Unpatch, Restore default, `cli game-patch remove`) undoes parts 1 and 2. Saves are never touched.

## Where new things plug in

| You want to | Touch |
|---|---|
| Add an update step | `pipeline.py` (key, `STEP_LABELS`, order in `build()`), the step's code (a `Builder` method or a module), `progress.STAGES` for its message, tests. The window lists it by itself through `steps_for()` |
| Add a club league | A provider in `tools/providers/`, `tools/club_slots.json`, `FEEDS` in `tools/build_datapack.py`, `estimate.LEAGUE_GAP`, the league's key in `pipeline.LEAGUE_ORDER`; mark it in `pipeline.EXPERIMENTAL` until played in the game (step by step in DEVELOPING.md) |
| Add a data source to the pack | `tools/build_datapack.py` (+ provider), a `sources` entry for the window's date line, `datasource.gather()` to pass it into `builder.Data` |
| Change a rule the game enforces | `verify.py` first (so a build that breaks it cannot be installed), then the builder; document it in FORMAT.md section 5 |
| Change the window | Behaviour and state in the controller (`app/update.py`, `app/editor.py`, `app/uniforms.py`, `app/equipment.py`, `app/lines.py`, `app/strategy.py`, `app/calendar.py`, `app/office.py`: a field in `snapshot()`, a method), the call in `window/api.py`, the look in `web/js/*.js` and `web/css/*.css` (shared pieces in `ui.js`). Keep the window toolkit out of `app/` and the engine. Test the controller with `tests/test_app.py`'s FakeHost; look at the result with `tools/window_shot.py`. The classic window is frozen |
| Add a team tab | A follower controller in `app/` (`follow`, `hide`, `roster_changed`, `snapshot`; `editor.follow_with('<tab>', self)`), its slice in `window/main.py`, its calls in `window/api.py`, an entry in `TEAM_TABS` (`app/editor.py`, `RAIL_TIPS`; `web/js/main.js`), a pane in `main.js` (step by step in DEVELOPING.md, "Add a team tab") |
| Add a command-line command | `cli.py` (`main()` registers sub-commands) |
| Change the game patch | `gamepatch.py` (a stage in `TEAM_STAGES`), `tools/audit_patch.py`, `tests/test_gamepatch.py`, a lab round (docs/GAME_PATCH.md section 5) |


## Starting without a roster save or a games-list entry (0.9.3)

`savedata.Rpcs3.game_disc(title_id)` looks in this order: RPCS3's `config/games.yml`, a game the player picked
(`Rpcs3(games={title_id: path})`, the window keeps them in settings.json `games`, the command line takes `--game`),
`dev_hdd0/disc/<id>` and `<rpcs3 folder>/games/<id>` (a folder with `PS3_GAME`). `savedata.game_title_id(path)` reads the title
id from an ISO's or folder's PARAM.SFO. `find_rpcs3` raises `NoGameError` (it carries the found `Rpcs3`) when RPCS3 has neither a
roster nor a game; the window then shows the "Pick the game" buttons (`App.browse_game`). `next_free` never gives `...00`
(the game's own slot): the first new save is `...01`. `restore.default_slot` is the game disc first (always the game's own data), else the
`...0200` save while it has the game's own layout: a roster this program made from the game's own roster has that layout too
and was wrongly taken as its own default (Restore default did nothing to the roster, fixed 0.9.3).

The Roster editor saves with `EditorTab.apply(quiet)` first (a card with typed but not applied changes is no longer lost on
Save or when another player is clicked) and `edits.people_and_copies` gives a player's national-team record the same edits.
