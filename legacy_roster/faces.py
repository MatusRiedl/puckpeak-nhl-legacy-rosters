"""A player's face: his 3D head (`cPbu.DaPp`, headid), skin colour (`QDTK`) and eye colour (`jfuZ`).

The heads the game can draw are the rows of table `vuqu` (stockplayerheads: a head id and its two hair cards, so the
hair comes with the head); ids from 60000 on are the generic heads that created players wear. Every head worn on the
disc's roster is in it. Skin colours run 1-10 on both the disc's and the community roster, eye colours 0-6 (the game's
Create Player offers 7; docs/notes/faces.md). The Roster editor gives a player another player's face or a generic head
(edits.py `set` keys `head`, `skin`, `eyes`); `problems` is verify()'s check of what an update changed.

**The created look** (the game's Create Player "Custom Head", lab D, docs/notes/draft-class.md "Faces of created
players"): only the 180 records the game keeps for Create Player (game ids 16000-16029 goalies, 16030-16179 skaters)
can have one. It is a head shape (`SHAPES`, the custom heads 20050-21200), a skin tone 1-16 (`skincolor` from
`TONE_SKIN`, `customfacetable.skintexture` tone - 1) and the record's row of `customfacetable` (`Vzjq`, `playerid` =
game id - 16000): hair, facial hair, eyebrows and their colours, black eye, scars, freckles. A look is kept in the
player's edit as the game's own numbers (`LOOK`, `DEFAULT_LOOK`); `look_problems` is verify()'s check.
