"""Export files to a folder: everything an update would put into RPCS3, made into a folder instead.

    run(...)                  the same update as the window's Update button, but the new roster, the pictures, the team
                              names and the game patch's files are written into a new folder next to the program, laid out
                              like RPCS3's own (dev_hdd0/..., patches/...), with HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt
    instructions(...)         what the player reads: which folder goes where on Windows, Linux (also Flatpak) and Mac

For a player whose RPCS3 the program cannot write into (Linux, a Mac, another PC) and for anyone who wants to look first.
It is the normal update pipeline run against an `ExportTarget`, a pretend RPCS3 that lives in the new folder:

  * `savedata.exporting()`: no RPCS3 counts as running (nothing is written into one);
  * `art.install.redirected()`: the lists of written files and the kept copies go to a work folder inside the new one, so the
    player's own lists (what is installed, what Restore puts back) are neither read nor changed;
  * the roster the update starts from (a save of RPCS3 or of a save folder, the game's own roster, or a SYS-DATA file) is
    copied into the work folder first and never touched; the work folder is deleted at the end.

Nothing is written outside the new folder, except what an update always keeps in the program's own folder (the list of
changes, downloaded pictures). Patch switches in RPCS3 (config/patch_config.yml) are not written: the player ticks them.
