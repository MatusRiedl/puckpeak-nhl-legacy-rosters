"""Give a club league its real clubs: every player of the league's rosters on his club.

The league data (from the data pack) already says which club goes into which team slot. For
each club the players are matched to records in the save; the ones that are not there get a
record of their own with estimated ratings. Whoever was on those slots before and is not on
the new roster leaves: prospect-pool players move to spare custom slots (pools.py), former club
players become free agents.

New players need spare records (donors.py). If those run out, every club first gets the players
it needs to dress a full line-up; the rest of the depth is skipped and listed in the report.
