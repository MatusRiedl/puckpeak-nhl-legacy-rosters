"""Which picture each player and club shows: the roster side of "Photos and logos".

A player's menu portrait is the art file p<artid>.big (`artid` and `hasportrait` in his record).
When photos are switched on, every player the update placed and who has a photo link gets one:

- an id the game already uses for him keeps it: the game's own ids (1-12,401, the disc's portraits) and
  the community roster's ids (12,402-13,826, its portrait pack). His file is replaced by the
  current photo;
- anyone else gets an id of his own from NEW_IDS. Ids are remembered per person on this PC
  (`Registry`), so the same player keeps his picture in every roster made here, and the next
  update writes the same ids again (a build on its own output stays byte-identical).

A picture file is shared by every roster of the game version, so a number is only good for one person on
the whole PC (testers, 0.10.4: a community roster's own numbers showed our photos of other people).
`Claims` says who else uses which number (every roster save, picture files another pack put there); a
number someone else uses is never given out, and one of ours that turns out to be someone else's is
forgotten (`forget_conflicts`): our player gets a fresh one and the file goes back to its owner
(install.give_back).

Clubs need no change in the roster: a club's logo is the file t<artid>.big of its team record.

`plan()` returns the pictures to make; `install.py` downloads, draws and writes them. Nothing
here needs Pillow.
