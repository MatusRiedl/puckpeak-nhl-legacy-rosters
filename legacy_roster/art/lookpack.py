"""The look pack (looks.zip): this season's jerseys and centre-ice logos, already in the PS3's layout (made by the
maintainer's private tools, DEVELOPING.md). It is downloaded from the program's file server while "Photos, logos and
team names" is on (packs.py, 0.32.0). Without it (not downloaded yet, offline), `LookPack.open()` returns None and
every team keeps the look it had (the game's own, or Utah / Seattle / Vegas made from their colours). `art/looks.py`
puts these pictures onto the player's own disc files (`looks.pack_team`, `looks.Maker.pack_files`).

                               200 px tall; since 2026-10-18, a pack without it gets the recoloured chassis picture)

"name" is the club the slot holds after an update (the data pack's full name; for the NHL the code, for the national
teams the abbreviation): a slot that holds another club keeps its own look.
