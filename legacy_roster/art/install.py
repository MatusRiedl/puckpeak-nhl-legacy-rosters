    prefetch(links, rpcs3, title_id)             before the roster is planned: which photos cannot be made
                                                 (no face, no download, NHL.com's grey stand-in)

    give_back(numbers)                           take our pictures off numbers someone else uses
    remove()                                     the "Restore the game's own pictures" button

The pictures go, as loose files, into the game's own folder on RPCS3's hard disk
(dev_hdd0/game/<TITLEID>/USRDIR/fe/ion/artassets/...); the game reads a loose file there before
the one on the disc (tested in the game on 2026-10-03). Each art file is made from one of the
player's own disc (a template) with only the picture swapped, so nothing of the game's is shipped, and
the photos and logos are downloaded on the player's PC from the leagues' public sites.

The European (BLES02153) and North American (BLUS31540) versions each have their own folder; their
discs hold the same art and text files, so one set of pictures made from either disc serves both
(`also`: further versions that receive every file too).

Safety: nothing is written while RPCS3 runs; any file replaced is first copied to
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\NHLLegacyRosterUpdater\\art\\backup, and a list of everything written, per game
folder (art\\installed.json), lets remove() put every file back as it was. A picture already
installed from the same link is not made again, so a later update downloads only new or changed
photos.

Needs Pillow (images.py); the window exe has it.
