"""The look of a team in the game's 3D world: jerseys, pants, socks, number sheets, the menu pictures of the jerseys
and the centre-ice logo (needs Pillow, imported when a picture is made; the engine's other modules never need it).

Why this exists (owner, 2026-10-06): Arizona is Utah now and slots 30 and 31 are still the All-Star teams, so their
jerseys and ice show the wrong team. The game takes every 3D texture from a loose file under
`<game folder>/rendering/...` before its disc (proven by `cli rendering-test`; RPCS3's log names the files Play Now
opens: style 1, variants 3 and 4 for Utah, and `centerlogo_22_cm`).

How a jersey is made. Every standard jersey of style 1 is painted on one shared shirt layout (the normal maps of Utah's,
Seattle's, Vegas's, Edmonton's and Vancouver's jerseys agree to 96-100 %). Utah's own style-1 jersey (variant 3 dark,
variant 4 light) is a flat three-colour design: a body colour, a yoke colour and a trim colour, with the crest and two
shoulder marks on top. `recolour()` swaps those three colours for the team's (keeping the cloth's shading), the crest and
shoulder marks are painted over with the team's own logo, and the result goes into the team's own file: every raster
keeps the size the disc's file has, so the file keeps its layout. Pants, socks and the number sheet go the same way.
Nothing of the game's is shipped: the chassis is read from the player's own disc each time (AGENTS rule 10).

Not every version of a team uses that layout: the old All-Star versions (Seattle and Vegas 0 and 1) and style 0 are
painted on other shirts. Those are left as they are (`STANDARD_LAYOUT`).

This season's jerseys (owner, 2026-10-16): the program carries the pack's kits and centre-ice logos of every team both games
have, already moved into the PS3's two cuts (`art/lookpack.py`). `pack_team` and `looks_from` put them onto the
player's own disc files: the dark default version gets the pack's dark kit, the light default its light one. The pack gives
home and away only (owner, 2026-10-18): a third and every other version stays the game's own, also where the pack has a
third kit.
Style 1 (the NHL, AHL, CHL, some European clubs) goes the way of the player's own colour map, on the chassis' relief
and number sheet; style 0 (the classic cut of most European clubs and the national teams) keeps the version's own file
with a clean relief (`style0_relief`: the median of 11 clubs' reliefs, which drops their embossed crests) and its own
number sheet in the pack's number colours. Pants and socks share one layout in both cuts: both get the chassis' in the
kit's colours (`kit_palette`). The Select Jerseys picture is the pack's own menu picture of the kit on the game's black
figure (`menu_picture`; the chassis' preview in the kit's colours only for a kit the pack has no menu picture for).
Proven in the lab: gate G2b (Utah,
Toronto), G3 (Davos, Sparta, Berlin, Canada) and round 31, private/notes/study.md. A club's pack centre ice goes
in only where the game shows it at that club's home games and nowhere else (`shown_centre`, `own_ice`): not the DEL's
(one shared ice) and not the national teams' (the game's international ice).

Every team of every league (owner, 2026-10-18) can have its jerseys chosen in the Roster editor's "Jerseys and ice" window
(app/uniforms.py; `editable`, `team_versions`): an NHL team every version, any other team its home and away versions,
each the pack's, the game's own, made from the colours (style 1 on the shared layout only) or the player's own picture.
Jerseys belong to an art id, not a slot: a team sharing its art id with a lower slot (the Winter Classic, EASHL and Top
Prospects teams) is changed at that slot (`jersey_owner`).
