"""New centre ice (the "Bright ice" switch; since 2026-10-27 the owner's newer set of centre-ice logos, before it the
community's centre circles on white).

The centre circle of the NHL teams 0-29, with the arenas' current names, goes into the player's own disc file, which
keeps its size and layout:

    rendering/icesurface/centerlogo_<art>_cm.rpsgl    the centre circle (1024 x 1024 DXT5, 11 mipmaps)
    rendering/icesurface/icesurface_22_bm.rpsgl       Utah's rink picture, with Arizona's coyote taken out (the game shows
                                                      it under the centre circle); left to `looks` when it drew one

The pack holds each centre's encoded raster as it is (no second round of compression), laid over the raster of the
disc's file; a disc file whose raster has another size, format or mipmaps is left as it is, with a line. Nothing of the
game is shipped. The pack (`ice`): index.json {"format": 1, "built": ..., "centres": {"<art id>": {"raster":
"centerlogo_<art>_cm", "width", "height", "mips", "format", "size", "id": digest, "file": "c/<art>.bin"}}}.

Which centre a team gets: the player's own (Jerseys & ice; `keep`), else this set, else this season's (`looks`: Seattle,
Vegas and the clubs), else the game's. pipeline.install_looks leaves the art ids of this set to it. NOT played in the game
yet.
