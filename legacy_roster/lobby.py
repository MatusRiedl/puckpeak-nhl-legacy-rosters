"""The lobby client of online play (Multiplayer.txt sections 4 D3/D6 and 5 Phase 1): the app's side of the server's small HTTPS API.
Standard library only. One request per call, no retries (the tab polls every 2 s). The lobbies live in the server's memory; the
ranks are worked out from the match reports the games send (0.90.0, docs/notes/online-match-reports.md).

The API (the server is Overtime, Overtime.Lobby/LobbyApi.cs; tests/fake_lobby.py answers the same):

    POST   <API>/lobby              {name, crc, patch, version, rpcs3, is_public, roster_name} -> a lobby (the caller is its host;
                                    is_public lists it for everybody, roster_name is shown in the list)
    GET    <API>/lobbies            -> [{code, host, roster_name, patch, version, roster_size, age_seconds, members, max}]: the public
                                    lobbies waiting for a friend (open, the host alone, his roster sent), newest first
    POST   <API>/lobby/<code>/join  {name, crc, patch, version, rpcs3}  -> the lobby (the caller is its guest)
    GET    <API>/lobby/<code>?name=  -> the lobby
    POST   <API>/lobby/<code>/ready {name, ready}                -> the lobby
    POST   <API>/lobby/<code>/leave {name}                       -> {}
    POST   <API>/lobby/<code>/me    {name, crc, patch, version, rpcs3}  -> the lobby (a member's roster / patch changed; his Ready goes)
    PUT    <API>/lobby/<code>/roster?name=  gzip bytes           -> the lobby (the host sends his roster)
    GET    <API>/lobby/<code>/roster?name=                       -> the host's roster (gzip bytes)
    POST   <API>/lobby/<code>/say   {name, text}                 -> the lobby (0.90: its `chat` gets the line)
    GET    <API>/board                                           -> {players, ranked, highlights, recent, tiers, placement, updated}
    GET    <API>/board/player?name=                              -> a player's card (404 unknown; a hidden one only to himself)
    GET    <API>/history?name=&limit=                            -> his matches, newest first
    POST   <API>/board/hide     {name, hidden}                   -> {name, hidden} (showing again needs his own token)

    a lobby = {code, state: open | starting | playing | expired, reason: why it cannot start (a text) or None,
               members: [{name, role: host | guest, roster_ok, patch_ok, ready, progress, patch, version, rpcs3}],
               roster: {crc, size} of the host's uploaded roster, or None, chat: [{seq, name, text, at}] (0.90 servers)}
    The host is the reference: a guest is roster_ok with the host's roster CRC and patch_ok with the host's patch. patch is the
    patch version ("0.26") or "none"; a host's expired lobby (he left) says state "expired".
    rpcs3 = the member's RPCS3 build number as text, '' when unknown: shown to the friend, never a gate. The game (version, "EU 01.00": the
    region and the game version) must be the host's, or the lobby says so and nobody can start; a member without the game patch (patch "none") cannot be Ready.
    progress = in_game | signed_in | hosting | browsing | joined | playing | gone (the server's view of that member)

The identity is the RPCN name the app reports (trust, as the community servers do), but acting for a member needs his secret: create
and join answer with a `token`, which this module keeps (never in the lobby it returns) and sends as the header X-Lobby-Token with
every later request for that lobby and name; a request without it is answered 403 not_member. An error answers with the HTTP status
4xx and {error, message}; LobbyError carries both. A server from before 0.90 answers the ranks and chat routes 404 with no body
(code http404): `missing` says so, and the tab then hides what needs them. D3 / D6 say who pairs: the host presses Create Game Session in the game,
the guest Browse then Join; the server shows the guest only the host's session.
