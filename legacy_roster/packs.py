"""The picture packs the program downloads from its own file server (0.32.0): `photos` (players' photos and club
logos), `looks` (this season's jerseys and centre-ice logos) and, since 0.76.0, `arenas`, `ice` and `masks`. They are
not inside the program. While a switch that needs a pack is on, the window downloads that pack (only that one) if it is
missing or changed, in the background (app/update.py, `sync(wanted=)`), and the next update uses it; the command line
downloads before `update --photos` (cli.py `packs`). A pack the server does not list yet is simply not offered.

    <files_url>manifest.json
        {"format": 1, "packs": {"photos": {"file": "photos-<sha12>.zip", "size": bytes, "sha256": "...",
                                           "built": "2026-10-20"},
                                "looks": {...}}}

On this PC the packs are in datasource.app_dir('packs'): `<name>-<sha12>.zip` and `state.json` ({name: manifest entry
+ 'local'}). A new pack gets a new file name, because Windows cannot replace a zip an update or the Jerseys window has
open; `prune` removes the old one at the next start, when nothing holds it any more. A download goes into
`<file>.part` and counts only when its size and SHA-256 match the manifest.

LEGACY_ROSTER_PACKS names a folder with photos.zip / looks.zip that is used instead (a developer's own packs,
private/packs); LEGACY_ROSTER_FILES_URL another server (datasource.files_url). The art modules open the packs with
`path(name)` (art/photopack.py, art/lookpack.py).
