"""The "Play online" tab without a window toolkit (Multiplayer.txt; docs/notes/multiplayer.md, S1 results): the player's
online account, the one-press setup, a lobby of two by code, the launch of RPCS3 into the game, and what RPCS3's log says.

Nothing of the player's RPCS3 is changed except through patchinstall (the online entry of the game patch, with the backups
that has) and the roster install (a save of the app's own, "Puck Peak Online ..."; the host's roster is copied into it when
he makes a lobby, the friend's when she joins: pressing Make a lobby / Join is the player's yes, and update_in_place keeps a
backup copy). The roster is the host's: it travels through the lobby server (lobby.py), and both players must have the same
roster CRC and the same game patch before they can be Ready. Online play needs the game patch (owner, 2026-10-25): Set up
online puts it in (after a question) with the online entry. The RPCS3 build is read from its log and told to the friend; a
build older than onlinecfg.MIN_RPCS3 is refused, a different one only gets a note. The game is started with the app's own config
file (onlinecfg.write_config); the player's config files are only read. The lobby calls go to the server (lobby.py)
and may run while RPCS3 runs; copying a roster needs RPCS3 closed.

The pairing in the game (S1): the host presses Create Game Session, the guest Browse Available Game Sessions and Join.
`steps` says which, by role. The tab is a follower of the team list only to know when it shows (`follow` / `hide`).
