"""The Roster editor tab without a window toolkit: what the page shows, and what its buttons do.

It shows the roster save picked in Setup as it is (the game's own roster too), plus the edits made
in this visit (`session`). The edits are kept on this PC (edits.py) and applied to every later update as
well, but earlier ones are not shown on top of a roster: they are in it once it was saved. Saving writes
what is shown after the same safety checks as an update, into the roster itself (a backup copy first,
savedata.update_in_place) or as a new roster, as the Update tab's choice says.

The page keeps what is typed on the card and sends it along with Apply, Save and a pick of another player
(`card`: see editor/card.py); a card that was typed on but not applied is applied first, as before. Slow work
(reading, rebuilding, saving, pictures) runs in a worker thread; the slices `editor` and `picture` say what
to show (the picture is a slice of its own, so the card's picture is not sent again with every change).

The six team tabs (Roster, Lines, Strategy, Jerseys & ice, Calendar, Front office) share one team list on the left
(the slice `rail`). This controller owns the picked league and team; the other tabs are "followers" (`follow_with`):
the follower of the tab in view gets follow(team) when the team changes or a roster is read, the others hide(), and all
get roster_changed() after a roster was read again (an edit, a save, another roster). Only the visible tab does work.
