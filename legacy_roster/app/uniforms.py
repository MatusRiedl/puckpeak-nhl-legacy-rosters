"""The Roster editor's "Jerseys and ice" window without a window toolkit: a team's jerseys and centre-ice logo.

    colours      the two colours (and a crest picture) the jerseys are made from
    versions     one row per jersey version the window offers (looks.team_versions: every version Play Now cycles
                 through with "Change Jerseys" for an NHL team, home and away elsewhere): the pack's kit (where the
                 program's look pack has one: art/lookpack.py), keep the game's own, make it from the colours (the
                 shared shirt layout only), or use the player's own picture
    ice          the centre-ice logo: the pack's, the game's own, drawn from the team's logo and arena name, or the player's
                 picture; outside the NHL only where the club's home games show its own (looks.own_ice), or, where
                 several teams share one ice (looks.ice_group: the national teams, the DEL, EASHL), the game's own or a
                 picture for all of them (one per group: saving it takes the group's other teams' ice choice away)

Every team of every league whose jerseys are its own (looks.editable) has the window; the files are the team's art id's
(Charlotte is slot 36, art 162), in its cut (most European clubs and the national teams: the classic cut, style 0). A
team wearing another team's jerseys (the Winter Classic teams, EASHL 2) opens that team's window, with a note
(looks.window_team). A custom team (slots 222-251) has its own form instead: app/teamkit.py.
What is chosen is kept in edits.json (`teams[slot]["uniforms"]` / `["ice"]`, see edits.py) and installed by every update that
has "Photos, logos and team names" on (art/looks.py); "Restore the game's own pictures" puts the game's own back. A player's own
jersey picture is a flat 1024 x 1024 colour map in the version's shirt layout: the window saves the game's own (and the pack's,
where it fits that layout) as a template to paint on. Reading the game's disc takes a moment, so it runs in worker threads
(editor/pictures.py `work`); the small pictures are a slice of their own (`thumbs`), so typing a colour does not send them
all again.
