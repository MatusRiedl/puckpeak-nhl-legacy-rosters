"""The player's own edits: kept on the PC and applied on top of every roster this program builds.

The roster editor (gui) stores what the player changed by hand; `pipeline.build()` applies it as
its last step, after the downloaded data, so a correction survives every later update. Edits are
about people, not records: each one names a player by plain name and birthdate (`person_key`), so
it finds him in any later roster whichever record he has there.
