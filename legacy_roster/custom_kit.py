"""The look of a custom team (slots 222-251: the prospect pools, Coachella Valley, Henderson, the switched-off ones).

The game draws these teams like teams made in Create a Team (lab rounds 34 and 37, docs/notes/lab-round-37.md), not from
jersey files of their own:
- team table `ttOk`: `jerseybackhome` / `jerseybackaway` the jersey design worn at home / away (0-8 = the Create a Team
  menu's jersey0-8 and `rendering/czjersey/jerseyct_<cut>_<n>`; 9 falls back to 0), `pantsstyle`, `sockstyle`, `font`
  (0-5: `czpant/pantct_<n>`, `czsock/texlib_<n>`, `czfont/czfont_<n>`), `artid` = 20001 + the create-a-team logo (the
  crest, `czlogo/logoct_<n>`), `primarycolor` / `secondarycolor` (menus, goalie gear);
- table `NDEo` (customteamequipmenttable): 30 teams x 11 pieces x home / away, team = slot + 1, variant 1 home / 2 away,
  zones 1-9 RGB (PIECES). Only the colours change here; the rows stay.

The Roster editor keeps a team's look in edits.json (`teams[slot]['kit']`, edits.py) and `write` puts it into the
roster. Standard library only.
