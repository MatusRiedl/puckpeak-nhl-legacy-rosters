    NHL.com does not list may be on the NHL roster of the organisation he is under contract with
    (Builder.contract_keeps), and only that one.
    `crests` ({slot: art id}): custom teams whose own crest picture the photos install (the Roster editor's kit): that art
    id is theirs alone (custom_kit.problems, which also checks the custom teams' designs and colour table).
    `contract_edits` ({player row: deal}): contracts the player set by hand (edits.apply_contracts): each player holds
    exactly that deal on the roster's scale, one the game can hold (contracts.edit_problems), and is with an NHL
    organisation (contract_edit_problems).
    `prospects` (draftclass.apply): the player's draft-class players: each is eligible for his class, undrafted, on a
    European or CHL club and has a potential inside his growth tier's band (draftclass.problems).
    `league_calendars` ({part: what schedule.apply_league returned}): the club leagues' calendars the update wrote, each
