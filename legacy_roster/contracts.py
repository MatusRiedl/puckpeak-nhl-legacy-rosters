"""Players' contracts in a roster (table cPbu) and the money scale of a save.

A contract is the cap hit per season `dhKk` in units of UNIT dollars (13 bits), the seasons left `GDhI` (this one
included), two-way `DVoL`, multi-year `gHmt` (= two seasons or more, as the community roster keeps it), and an
extension that starts next season: years `IrlK`, cap hit `IzRv`, two-way `xdoJ` (docs/notes/contracts.md).

The game's own salary cap is $71.4M (docs/notes/salary-cap.md). A roster for the 32-team game patch holds real 2026-27
dollars (REAL) and the patch raises the cap to 2026-27's; every other roster holds them times GAME = 71.4 / 104.0, so
that a team's payroll fits the game's cap as the real one fits the real cap (owner, 2026-10-16). `rescale` moves a
roster's money from one scale to the other once, when a normal roster becomes a patch roster or back.

The real deals come from the data pack part `contracts` (made by the maintainer's private tools, DEVELOPING.md):
    {'first', 'last', 'birth': [y, m, d], 'pos': 'C', 'org': 'EDM', 'cap': 12500000, 'years': 2, 'two_way': 0,
     'ext': [years, cap, two_way]}       (ext only when he has signed an extension)
Those are NHL contracts only: nobody outside an NHL organisation has one there, nor in the game's own roster. Since
2026-10-22 (owner: "a tool to actually make it happen for players to have contracts") every club player without a deal
and without NHL rights gets a made-up starter deal with his club (`starter_terms`), and a contract set by hand may be with
any club (`contract_home`, free amounts outside NHL organisations: `edit_problems(nhl=False)`).
