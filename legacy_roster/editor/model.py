"""What a roster holds, in the shape the roster editor shows it (no window code here).

`Snapshot` reads a roster save into teams and players; `compare()` tells what the player's edits
changed between two of them (the roster as it is and with this session's edits). Players are matched
across rosters by person (edits.who_of: plain name + birthdate), because an edit may give a player
another record. `apply_edits()` makes the roster with the edits (no window needed).
