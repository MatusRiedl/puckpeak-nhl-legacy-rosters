"""The game patch in RPCS3 (gamepatch.py): put it in, tell whether it is in, and take it out again.

    install_patch(rpcs3, titles, intro=, login=)   the window's Patch button (step 2), cli game-patch install
    set_switches(rpcs3, titles, intro, login)      the two small switches of a patched game, changed
    set_online(rpcs3, titles, on)                  the online entry (our server's words) ticked or not, with or without the 32 teams
    refresh_db(rpcs3, titles, roster)              after a patched update: the db files hold that roster's calendars
    state(rpcs3) / patched_titles(rpcs3)           {title id: {'patched', 'version', 'game', 'stale', ...}} / the patched ones
    remove(rpcs3)                                  the Unpatch button (and Restore default)

A patched game needs three things together (docs/GAME_PATCH.md):
  * RPCS3's patch file patches/<TITLEID>_patch.yml (gamepatch.player_patch_text: one entry with the year and the 32 teams,
    the intro, login and news entries, for the game's 1.00 and for update 1.01, whichever RPCS3 runs: game_version) and
    the switches in config/patch_config.yml (RPCS3's list of ticked entries; the news entry is ticked with the 32 teams,
    the intro and login entries are the window's two switches);
  * the game's database description and database for 32 teams, db/nhlng-meta.xml and db/nhlng.db, as loose files in the
    game's folder (dev_hdd0/game/<TITLEID>/USRDIR), made from the player's own disc (no file of the game's is shipped); the
    database carries the next seasons' calendars, made from the data pack as a patch roster has them (calendar_roster);
  * a roster made for the patch (pipeline.patch_roster): every update while the game is patched makes one.

Safety, as for the pictures (art/install.py): nothing is written while RPCS3 runs; a patch file or db file that was there
before is copied aside and comes back on remove(); the list of what was written is the program's own 'patch' store
(%LOCALAPPDATA%\\NHLLegacyRosterUpdater\\patch), apart from the pictures', so "Restore the game's own pictures" leaves the
patch alone and Unpatch leaves the pictures. patch_config.yml is RPCS3's file with every game's switches: only our
entries' lines under our PPU hashes (EU 1.00, NA 1.00, update 1.01 for both) are added or taken out, every other line
stays as it is, entries that already had our names come back as they were (config_before.json), and a copy of the file
is kept (patch/backup) before the first change. Rosters and Season / Be a GM saves are never touched.
