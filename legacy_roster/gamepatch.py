"""The game patch for RPCS3 (docs/notes/patch-design.md): the game's dates in 2026 instead of 2015, and later 32 teams in
Season, Be a GM and Be a Pro. RPCS3 applies it while the game runs; the game's own files are never changed.

Only the year entry exists so far (`cli year-test`, the in-game check). Version 0.1 showed 13 October 2026 in the lab
and crashed creating a Season; 0.2 wrote `code_alloc`, a name RPCS3 does not know (the same crash). Version 0.3 (the year
window, YEAR_CAVE, `calloc`) PASSED in the lab (2026-10-12): the game shows 2026, Crosby is 39, Season and Be a GM start,
Anaheim has its real games.

The patch moves the game's dates by 11 years: the calendar, the season's start, the day ages are counted on. The
league's own year stays 2015 (YEAR_LABELS), and the game counts ages from it too, so the date-based age takes the birth
year 11 later and the roster keeps birth years on the league's clock: the real year - 1911, where this program's
normal update stores year - 1910 (docs/FORMAT.md). `year_shift` turns a roster into the patched way; the normal update
does not do it.
