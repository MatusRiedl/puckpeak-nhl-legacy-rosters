"""The lines teams announce, for the data pack (part `lines`, 0.50.5; owner, 2026-10-24: "we need the real lines").

NHL.com cannot say who plays centre when two centres share a line (McDavid and Draisaitl are both listed C): shifts and
face-offs do not settle it. Daily Faceoff's team pages (https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/teams/<team>/line-combinations, allowed by
its robots.txt) carry the answer as page data: four lines (LW / C / RW), three pairs, two goalies, power-play units 1 / 2
(five skaters, any mix of forwards and defencemen) and penalty-kill units 1 / 2 (four skaters). Only who plays where is
taken, matched to NHL.com's current roster (the data pack's players are NHL.com ids), one page and one roster request per
team. Output: {team code: {'date', 'source', 'slots'}} with `slots` {slot name (schema.SLOT_TAG): NHL.com player id}; a
group with a player NHL.com's roster lacks is left out (the games' lines fill it, tools/providers/nhl_lines.py).
