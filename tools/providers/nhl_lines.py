"""Real lines from real games, for the data pack (part `lines`, 0.50.4; owner, 2026-10-24: "lines real from real games").

For each NHL team, its last GAMES finished regular-season games (NHL.com schedule), and per game the box score (who
dressed, positions, goalies' time) and the shift chart (who was on the ice second by second). From that, only for the
team's players of its latest game:
  * even strength (5 v 5): the forward trios and defence pairs that skated together most, best line = most ice time;
  * power play / penalty kill: the forwards and defencemen ranked by their time in that state (then by even-strength
    time), split into units 1 / 2;
  * goalies: the one with most ice time over the games is the starter.
Overtime, the shootout and the extra attackers are left out (the builder deals them by rating). No scraping and no
guessing: NHL.com's own numbers, one request per game for each. Output: {team code: {'date', 'games', 'slots',
'letters'}} with `slots` {slot name (schema.SLOT_TAG): NHL.com player id}; a slot the games cannot name is missing.
`letters` {NHL.com player id (str): 'C' | 'A'}: the captain and alternates as NHL.com's official game roster report of
each game marks them ("ADAM LOWRY  (C)"), counted over the games (providers/letters.py).
