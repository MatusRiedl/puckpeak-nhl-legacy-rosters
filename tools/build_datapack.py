"""Build the data pack the updater ships with and downloads (legacy_roster/data/datapack.json.gz).

    python tools/build_datapack.py                     rebuild from the caches in tools/cache
    python tools/build_datapack.py --refresh ratings   refresh the current ratings list first (slow, polite; private/)

    python tools/build_datapack.py --research DIR      reuse the lab's research folder as the cache

The pack holds everything the updater does not fetch live:
    ratings_list the current ratings of NHL players (name, team, overall, attributes)
    iihf         rosters for the national teams the base roster leaves empty
    leagues      club rosters per league, already placed into the game's team slots (tools/club_slots.json)
                 (the AHL's: the 32 clubs' rosters of the maintainer's private source, tools/cache/ahl_rosters.json,
                 with each player's NHL organisation; the feed only adds photos and letters: --refresh ahl_rosters)
    nhl          a snapshot of the NHL rosters, used only when the user is offline
    nhl_last     everyone who played in the NHL last season (birthdate, size, hand, team now): who is
                 retired and who is an unsigned free agent (refreshed with nhl)
    drafts       every NHL draft pick since FIRST_DRAFT (refreshed with nhl)
    schedule     every regular-season game of the season (date, home, away): the game's calendar
                 (refreshed with nhl, or alone: --refresh schedule)
    ahl_schedule every AHL regular-season game (date, home slot, away slot): the 32-team game patch's farm
                 calendar and the AHL's calendar on other rosters (refreshed with ahl, or alone: --refresh ahl_schedule)
    schedules    every regular-season game of the other club leagues, per league part (shl, liiga, extraliga, del,
                 nl, norway, ohl, qmjhl, whl): [date, home, away], a club as its team slot, or as its name in the feed
                 when the game has no slot for it (refreshed with the league, or alone: --refresh schedules, or one
                 league's: --refresh shl_schedule)
    contracts    the real 2026-27 NHL contracts (--refresh contracts [--db FILE]; legacy_roster/contracts.py)
    ratings_full the current ratings, player types and tendencies of every player, all leagues
                 (--refresh ratings_full [--db FILE], no network)
    retired      players who announced their retirement, kept by hand in tools/retired.json (copied on every build;
                 NHL.com marks no retirement); the unsigned of last season aged 38+ retire without it (builder)
    equipment    the real sock tuck, pants, tape and neck guard of the NHL's and AHL's players, as raw numbers
                 (--refresh equipment [--db FILE], no network; `datasource.equipment_part`)
    club_lines   the clubs' real lines outside the NHL, per club slot: the Extraliga's match line-ups (--refresh
                 extraliga_lines, hokej.cz) over a larger private database's lines (--refresh club_lines [--db FILE],
                 no network; made from the pack's own rosters, so refresh the leagues first)
    captains     not a part: every league player's `letter` and `lines[code]['letters']` (NHL.com ids) are this
                 season's games' (NHL.com's game rosters, HockeyTech's game summaries, the Extraliga's match line-ups,
                 refreshed with lines / ahl / chl / extraliga_lines), else the larger database's (club_lines) where
                 the games named nobody on that team (give_letters; docs/notes/captains.md)

ratings_list, contracts, ratings_full, equipment and the AHL's rosters are made by the maintainer's private tools (private/, kept
out of git, DEVELOPING.md). Without them those parts are taken over from the pack being replaced, as they are.

Before writing, every part is compared with the pack being replaced: a part that is gone or has
lost more than 40% of its entries stops the build (a feed that changed its layout looks like that).
Pass --accept-drops when the drop is real.
